  abstract = {We present an accurate algorithm to predict the minimum
                  free energy structure of RNA-RNA interaction under the
                  most general type of interaction studied in the
                  literature. Moreover, we introduce a fast heuristic
                  algorithm to predict multiple binding sites of two
                  interacting RNAs incorporating accessibility of target
                  sites. We verify the performance of our algorithms for
                  joint structure and binding site prediction on a set
                  of known interacting RNA pairs. Experimental results
                  show that our methods are highly accurate and
                  outperform the other competitive approaches.} ,
