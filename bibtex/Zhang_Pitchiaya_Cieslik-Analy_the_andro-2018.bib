  abstract =	 {The androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in the 
                  development of the normal prostate as well as prostate 
                  cancer. Using an integrative transcriptomic analysis of 
                  prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, we identified ARLNC1 
                  (AR-regulated long noncoding RNA 1) as an important long 
                  noncoding RNA that is strongly associated with AR signaling 
                  in prostate cancer progression. Not only was ARLNC1 induced 
                  by the AR protein, but ARLNC1 stabilized the AR transcript 
                  via RNA-RNA interaction. ARLNC1 knockdown suppressed AR 
                  expression, global AR signaling and prostate cancer growth 
                  in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data support a 
                  role for ARLNC1 in maintaining a positive feedback loop that 
                  potentiates AR signaling during prostate cancer progression 
                  and identify ARLNC1 as a novel therapeutic target.}
