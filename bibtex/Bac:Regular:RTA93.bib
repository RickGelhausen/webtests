  abstract = {We examine the existential fragment of a feature logic,
                  which is extended by regular path expressions. A
                  regular path expression is a subterm relation, where
                  the allowed paths for the subterms are restricted by a
                  regular language. We will prove that satisfiability is
                  decidable. This is achieved by setting up a
                  quasi-terminating rewrite system.
