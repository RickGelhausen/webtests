  abstract =	 {We present a generic, problem independent algorithm for
                  exploration of the lowenergy portion of the energy landscape
                  of discrete systems and apply it to the energy landscape of
                  lattice proteins. Starting from a set of optimal and
                  near-optimal conformations derived from a constraint-based
                  search technique, we are able to selectively investigate the
                  lower part of lattice protein energy landscapes in two and
                  three dimensions. This novel approach allows, in contrast to
                  exhaustive enumeration, for an eOEcient calculation of
                  optimal and near-optimal structures below a given energy
                  threshold and is only limited by the available amount of
                  memory. A straightforward application of the algorithm is
                  calculation of barrier trees (representing the energy
                  landscape), which then allows dynamics studies based on
                  landscape theory.}
