  abstract =	 {Alternative splicing at donor or acceptor sites located 
                  just a few nucleotides apart is widespread in many species. 
                  It results in subtle changes in the transcripts and often in 
                  the encoded proteins. Several of these tandem splice events 
                  contribute to the repertoire of functionally different 
                  proteins, whereas many are neutral or deleterious. 
                  Remarkably, some of the functional events are differentially 
                  spliced in tissues or developmental stages, whereas others 
                  exhibit constant splicing ratios, indicating that function 
                  is not always associated with differential splicing. 
                  Stochastic splice site selection seems to play a major role 
                  in these processes. Here, we review recent progress in 
                  understanding functional and evolutionary aspects as well as 
                  the mechanism of splicing at short-distance tandem sites.}
