    abstract = "{Generating publication ready plots to display multiple genomic tracks can pose a serious challenge. Making desirable and accurate figures requires considerable effort. This is usually done by hand or by using a vector graphic software.pyGenomeTracks (PGT) is a modular plotting tool that easily combines multiple tracks. It enables a reproducible and standardized generation of highly customizable and publication ready images.PGT is available through a graphical interface on https://usegalaxy.eu and through the command line. It is provided on conda via the bioconda channel, on pip and it is openly developed on github: https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",
