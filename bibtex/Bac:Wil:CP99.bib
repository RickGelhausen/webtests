  abstract = {
  We introduce a new method for excluding symmetries in
  constraint based search. To our knowledge, it is the
  first declarative method that can be applied to {\em
    arbitrary} symmetries. Our method is based on the
  notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in
  our modification of a general constraint based search
  algorithm. The method does not influence the search
  strategy. Furthermore, it can be used with either the
  full set of symmetries, or with an subset of all
  symmetries.

  We proof correctness, completeness and symmetry
  exclusion properties of our method. We then show how
  to apply the method in the special case of geometric
  symmetries (rotations and reflections) and
  permutation symmetries. Furthermore, we give results
  from practical applications.
