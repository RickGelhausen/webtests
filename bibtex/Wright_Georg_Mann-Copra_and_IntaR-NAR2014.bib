  abstract =	 {CopraRNA (Comparative prediction algorithm for small RNA 
                  targets) is the most recent asset to the Freiburg RNA Tools 
                  webserver. It incorporates and extends the functionality of 
                  the existing tool IntaRNA (Interacting RNAs) in order to 
                  predict targets, interaction domains and consequently the 
                  regulatory networks of bacterial small RNA molecules. The 
                  CopraRNA prediction results are accompanied by extensive 
                  postprocessing methods such as functional enrichment 
                  analysis and visualization of interacting regions. Here, we 
                  introduce the functionality of the CopraRNA and IntaRNA 
                  webservers and give detailed explanations on their 
                  postprocessing functionalities. Both tools are freely 
                  accessible at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de.}
