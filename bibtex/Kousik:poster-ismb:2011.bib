  abstract = {Computational identification of binding partners for Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains is important to understand almost all cellular functions. In this study we applied support vector machine to identify binding and non-binding partners of SH2 domains and phosphotyrosine containing peptides. We achieved an acceptable area under the ROC curve score  with 10-fold cross-validation.},
