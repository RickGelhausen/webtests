  abstract =	 {We present a global search technique for finding the
                  minimal conformation of a sequence in Dill's
                  HP-lattice model~[Lau:89a,Lau:90a]. The HP-lattice
                  model is a simplified model of proteins, that has
                  become a major tool for investigating general
                  properties of protein folding. The search technique
                  uses constraint programming for efficiently pruning
                  the search tree. We state the problem of structure
                  prediction in the HP-lattice model and describe our
                  implementation using the Oz-system.},
