  abstract =	 {Dynamic programming algorithms solve many standard problems 
                  of RNA bioinformatics in polynomial time. In this 
                  contribution we discuss a series of variations on these 
                  standard methods that implement refined biophysical models, 
                  such as a restriction of RNA folding to canonical 
                  structures, and an extension of structural alignments to an 
                  explicit scoring of stacking propensities. Furthermore, we 
                  demonstrate that a local structural alignment can be 
                  employed for ncRNA gene finding. In this context we discuss 
                  scanning variants for folding and alignment algorithms.}
