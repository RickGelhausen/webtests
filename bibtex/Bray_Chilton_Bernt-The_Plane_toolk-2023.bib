  abstract =	 {There are thousands of well-maintained high-quality 
                  open-source software utilities for all aspects of scientific 
                  data analysis. For more than a decade, the Galaxy Project 
                  has been providing computational infrastructure and a 
                  unified user interface for these tools to make them 
                  accessible to a wide range of researchers. To streamline the 
                  process of integrating tools and constructing workflows as 
                  much as possible, we have developed Planemo, a software 
                  development kit for tool and workflow developers and Galaxy 
                  power users. Here we outline Planemo's implementation and 
                  describe its broad range of functionality for designing, 
                  testing, and executing Galaxy tools, workflows, and training 
                  material. In addition, we discuss the philosophy underlying 
                  Galaxy tool and workflow development, and how Planemo 
                  encourages the use of development best practices, such as 
                  test-driven development, by its users, including those who 
                  are not professional software developers.}
