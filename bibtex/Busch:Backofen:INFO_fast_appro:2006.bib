  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: The structure of RNA molecules is often crucial 
                  for their function. Therefore, secondary structure 
                  prediction has gained much interest. Here, we consider the 
                  inverse RNA folding problem, which means designing RNA 
                  sequences that fold into a given structure. RESULTS: We 
                  introduce a new algorithm for the inverse folding problem 
                  (INFO-RNA) that consists of two parts; a dynamic programming 
                  method for good initial sequences and a following improved 
                  stochastic local search that uses an effective neighbor 
                  selection method. During the initialization, we design a 
                  sequence that among all sequences adopts the given structure 
                  with the lowest possible energy. For the selection of 
                  neighbors during the search, we use a kind of look-ahead of 
                  one selection step applying an additional energy-based 
                  criterion. Afterwards, the pre-ordered neighbors are tested 
                  using the actual optimization criterion of minimizing the 
                  structure distance between the target structure and the mfe 
                  structure of the considered neighbor. We compared our 
                  algorithm to RNAinverse and RNA-SSD for artificial and 
                  biological test sets. Using INFO-RNA, we performed better 
                  than RNAinverse and in most cases, we gained better results 
                  than RNA-SSD, the probably best inverse RNA folding tool on 
                  the market. AVAILABILITY:
