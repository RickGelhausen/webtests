  abstract =	 {Lattice protein models are a major tool for
                  investigating principles of protein folding. For
                  this purpose, one needs an algorithm that is
                  guaranteed to find the minimal energy conformation
                  in some lattice model (at least for some
                  sequences). So far, there are only algorithm that
                  can find optimal conformations in the cubic
                  lattice. In the more interesting case of the
                  face-centered-cubic lattice (FCC), which is more
                  protein-like, there are no results. One of the
                  reasons is that for finding optimal conformations,
                  one usually applies a branch-and-bound technique,
                  and there are no reasonable bounds known for the
                  FCC. We will give such a bound for Dill's HP-model
                  on the FCC.},
