  abstract =	 {Symmetry breaking by adding symmetric constraints
                  during search usually assumes that symmetric
                  constraints are simple. We identify symmetries with
                  complex symmetric constraints, where the symmetries
                  nevertheless can be handled by a similar method. For
                  this aim, we introduce partial symmetries. We
                  identify those symmetries in two problems. The photo
                  problem is a well known example problem, while the
                  alignment problem is a real world problem from
                  bioinformatics.}
