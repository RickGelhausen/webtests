  abstract = {Myeloid cells such as resident retinal microglia (MG) or
              infiltrating blood-derived macrophages (Mϕ) accumulate in areas
              of retinal ischemia and neovascularization (RNV) and modulate
              neovascular eye disease. Their temporospatial distribution and
              biological function in this process, however, remain unclarified.
              Using state-of-the-art methods, including cell-specific reporter
              mice and high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA Seq), this study
              determined the extent of MG proliferation and Mϕ infiltration in
              areas with retinal ischemia and RNV in Cx3cr1CreERT2
              :Rosa26-tdTomato mice and examined the transcriptional profile of
              MG in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). For
              RNA Seq, tdTomato-positive retinal MG were sorted by flow
              cytometry followed by Gene ontology (GO) cluster analysis.
              Furthermore, intraperitoneal injections of the cell proliferation
              marker 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) were performed from
              postnatal day (p) 12 to p16. We found that MG is the predominant
              myeloid cell population while Mϕ rarely appears in areas of RNV.
              Thirty percent of retinal MG in areas of RNV were EdU-positive
              indicating a considerable local MG cell expansion. GO cluster
              analysis revealed an enrichment of clusters related to cell
              division, tubulin binding, ATPase activity, protein kinase
              regulatory activity, and chemokine receptor binding in MG in the
              OIR model compared to untreated controls. In conclusion,
              activated retinal MG alter their transcriptional profile, exhibit
              considerable proliferative ability and are by far the most
              frequent myeloid cell population in areas of ischemia and RNV in
              the OIR model thus presenting a potential target for future
              therapeutic approaches.},
