abstract = {The Classroom Assignment problem consists of scheduling
            a set of courses into a fixed number of rooms, given a fixed
            timetable. At the University of Munich, a classroom plan has to be
            created each semester after collecting timetables of all departments
            and wishes of teachers. This planning is very complex since a lot of
            constraints have to be met, e.g.  room size and equipment. Using
            constraint-based programming, we developed a prototype, called
            RoomPlan, that supports automatic creation of classroom plans. With
            RoomPlan a schedule can be created interactively within some minutes
            instead of some days. RoomPlan was presented at the Systems'99
            Computer exhibition in Munich.}

abstract = {Transposable elements are viewed as 'selfish genetic 
            elements', yet they contribute to gene regulation and genome 
            evolution in diverse ways. More than half of the human 
            genome consists of transposable elements. Alu elements 
            belong to the short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) 
            family of repetitive elements, and with over 1 million 
            insertions they make up more than 10% of the human genome. 
            Despite their abundance and the potential evolutionary 
            advantages they confer, Alu elements can be mutagenic to the 
            host as they can act as splice acceptors, inhibit 
            translation of mRNAs and cause genomic instability. Alu 
            elements are the main targets of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR 
            and the formation of Alu exons is suppressed by the nuclear 
            ribonucleoprotein HNRNPC, but the broad effect of massive 
            secondary structures formed by inverted-repeat Alu elements 
            on RNA processing in the nucleus remains unknown. Here we 
            show that DHX9, an abundant nuclear RNA helicase, binds 
            specifically to inverted-repeat Alu elements that are 
            transcribed as parts of genes. Loss of DHX9 leads to an 
            increase in the number of circular-RNA-producing genes and 
            amount of circular RNAs, translational repression of 
            reporters containing inverted-repeat Alu elements, and 
            transcriptional rewiring (the creation of mostly nonsensical 
            novel connections between exons) of susceptible loci. 
            Biochemical purifications of DHX9 identify the 
            interferon-inducible isoform of ADAR (p150), but not the 
            constitutively expressed ADAR isoform (p110), as an 
            RNA-independent interaction partner. Co-depletion of ADAR 
            and DHX9 augments the double-stranded RNA accumulation 
            defects, leading to increased circular RNA production, 
            revealing a functional link between these two enzymes. Our 
            work uncovers an evolutionarily conserved function of DHX9. 
            We propose that it acts as a nuclear RNA resolvase that 
            neutralizes the immediate threat posed by transposon 
            insertions and allows these elements to evolve as tools for 
            the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.}

            understand biological systems as a whole in terms of 
            interactions of the individual cellular components. One of 
            the main building blocks in this field of study is 
            proteomics where tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in 
            combination with isotopic labelling techniques provides a 
            common way to obtain a direct insight into regulation at the 
            protein level. Methods to identify and quantify the peptides 
            contained in a sample are well established, and their output 
            usually results in lists of identified proteins and 
            calculated relative abundance values. The next step is to 
            move ahead from these abstract lists and apply statistical 
            inference methods to compare measurements, to identify genes 
            that are significantly up- or down-regulated, or to detect 
            clusters of proteins with similar expression profiles. 
            RESULTS: We introduce the Rich Internet Application (RIA) 
            Qupe providing comprehensive data management and analysis 
            functions for LC-MS/MS experiments. Starting with the import 
            of mass spectra data the system guides the experimenter 
            through the process of protein identification by database 
            search, the calculation of protein abundance ratios, and in 
            particular, the statistical evaluation of the quantification 
            results including multivariate analysis methods such as 
            analysis of variance or hierarchical cluster analysis. While 
            a data model to store these results has been developed, a 
            well-defined programming interface facilitates the 
            integration of novel approaches. A compute cluster is 
            utilized to distribute computationally intensive 
            calculations, and a web service allows to interchange 
            information with other -omics software applications. To 
            demonstrate that Qupe represents a step forward in 
            quantitative proteomics analysis an application study on 
            Corynebacterium glutamicum has been carried out. 
            Availability and Implementation: Qupe is implemented in Java 
            utilizing Hibernate, Echo2, R and the Spring framework. We 
            encourage the usage of the RIA in the sense of the 'software 
            as a service' concept, maintained on our servers and

As a result, CRISPRloci is able to accurately determine  the  CRISPR  array  and  associated  information, such as: the Cas subtypes; cassette boundaries;  accuracy  of  the  repeat  structure,  orientation and  leader  sequence;  virus-host  interactions;  self-targeting; as well as the annotation of cas genes, all of which have been missing from existing tools. This annotation  is  presented  in  an  interactive  interface, making it easy for scientists to gain an overview of the CRISPR system in their organism of interest.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems almost 20 
            years ago rapidly changed our perception of the bacterial 
            and archaeal immune systems. CRISPR loci consist of several 
            repetitive DNA sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by 
            stretches of variable length sequences called spacers. This 
            CRISPR array is transcribed and processed into multiple 
            mature RNA species (crRNAs). A single crRNA is integrated 
            into an interference complex, together with 
            CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade 
            invading nucleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics 
            tools can recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic 
            repeat-spacer architecture, they generally output CRISPR 
            arrays of ambiguous orientation and thus do not determine 
            the strand from which crRNAs are processed. Knowledge of the 
            correct orientation is crucial for many tasks, including the 
            classification of CRISPR conservation, the detection of 
            leader regions, the identification of target sites 
            (protospacers) on invading genetic elements and the 
            characterization of protospacer-adjacent motifs. RESULTS: We 
            present a fast and accurate tool to determine the 
            crRNA-encoding strand at CRISPR loci by predicting the 
            correct orientation of repeats based on an advanced machine 
            learning approach. Both the repeat sequence and mutation 
            information were encoded and processed by an efficient graph 
            kernel to learn higher-order correlations. The model was 
            trained and tested on curated data comprising >4500 CRISPRs 
            and yielded a remarkable performance of 0.95 AUC ROC (area 
            under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic). In 
            addition, we show that accurate orientation information 
            greatly improved detection of conserved repeat sequence 
            families and structure motifs. We integrated CRISPRstrand 
            predictions into our CRISPRmap web server of CRISPR 
            conservation and updated the latter to version 2.0.

            system in many archaea and bacteria, which provides 
            resistance against invading genetic elements. The first 
            phase of CRISPR-Cas immunity is called adaptation, in which 
            small DNA fragments are excised from genetic elements and 
            are inserted into a CRISPR array generally adjacent to its 
            so called leader sequence at one end of the array. It has 
            been shown that transcription initiation and adaptation 
            signals of the CRISPR array are located within the leader. 
            However, apart from promoters, there is very little 
            knowledge of sequence or structural motifs or their possible 
            functions. Leader properties have mainly been characterized 
            through transcriptional initiation data from single 
            organisms but large-scale characterization of leaders has 
            remained challenging due to their low level of sequence 
            conservation. RESULTS: We developed a method to successfully 
            detect leader sequences by focusing on the consensus repeat 
            of the adjacent CRISPR array and weak upstream conservation 
            signals. We applied our tool to the analysis of a 
            comprehensive genomic database and identified several

abstract = {In recent a paper [5], we have proposed a new method
            called "Russian Doll Search with Tree Decomposition"
            to improve optimization in weighted CSP
            frameworks. This approach is based on identifying
            conditionally independent subproblems, which are
            solved independently and whose optimum is cached, in
            the Branch and Bound algorithm. The central idea was
            to (inductively) solve a relaxation of each
            subproblem to strengthen bounds in order to overcome
            weakness associated to the locality of bounds
            induced by decomposition, which often hampers the
            practical effects of this result, because
            subproblems are often uselessly solved to
            optimality. The algorithm obtained, BTD-RDS,
            generalizes both RDS and treedecomposition based
            algorithms such as BTD or AND-OR Branch and
            Bound. Experimentation have been done on the one
            hand on CELAR benchmark [1], closing a very hard
            frequency assignment instance which has been open
            for more than 10 years and on the other hand on a
            new benchmark from bioinformatic field: the tagsnp
            selection. ...}

            RNAs is a biologically meaningful problem. By
            detecting such regions, biologists are able to
            identify functional similarity between the inspected
            molecules. We developed dynamic programming
            algorithms for finding common structure-sequence
            patterns between two RNAs. The RNAs are given by
            their sequence and a set of potential base pairs
            with associated probabilities. In contrast to prior
            work which matches fixed structures, we support the
            arc breaking edit operation; this allows to match
            only a subset of the given base pairs. We present an
            $O(n^3)$ algorithm for local exact pattern matching
            between two nested RNAs, and an $O(n^3 logn)$

abstract = {Laterality defects are defined by the perturbed left-right 
            arrangement of organs in the body, occurring in a syndromal 
            or isolated fashion. In humans, primary ciliary dyskinesia 
            (PCD) is a frequent underlying condition of defective 
            left-right patterning, where ciliary motility defects also 
            result in reduced airway clearance, frequent respiratory 
            infections, and infertility. Non-motile cilia dysfunction 
            and dysfunction of non-ciliary genes can also result in 
            disturbances of the left-right body axis. Despite 
            long-lasting genetic research, identification of gene 
            mutations responsible for left-right patterning has remained 
            surprisingly low. Here, we used whole-exome sequencing with 
            Copy Number Variation (CNV) analysis to delineate the 
            underlying molecular cause in 35 mainly consanguineous 
            families with laterality defects. We identified causative 
            gene variants in 14 families with a majority of mutations 
            detected in genes previously associated with PCD, including 
            two small homozygous CNVs. None of the patients were 
            previously clinically diagnosed with PCD, underlining the 
            importance of genetic diagnostics for PCD diagnosis and 
            adequate clinical management. Identified variants in 
            non-PCD-associated genes included variants in PKD1L1 and 
            PIFO, suggesting that dysfunction of these genes results in 
            laterality defects in humans. Furthermore, we detected 
            candidate variants in GJA1 and ACVR2B possibly associated 
            with situs inversus. The low mutation detection rate of this 
            study, in line with other previously published studies, 
            points toward the possibility of non-coding genetic 
            variants, putative genetic mosaicism, epigenetic, or 
            environmental effects promoting laterality defects.}

                 sequence downstream the UGA-codon that 
                 forms a hairpin-like structure (called 
                 Sec insertion sequence (SECIS)). 
                 Selenoproteins have gained much 
                 interest recently since they are very 
                 important for human health.
                 
                 In contrast, very little is known about 
                 selenoproteins. For example, there is 
                 only one solved crystal structure 
                 available. One reason for this is that 
                 one is not able to produce enough 
                 amount of selenoproteins by using 
                 recombinant expression in a system like
                 E.coli. The reason is that the 
                 insertion mechanisms are different 
                 between E.coli and eukaryotes. Thus, 
                 one has to redesign the human/mammalian 
                 selenoprotein for the expression in 
                 E.coli. In this paper, we introduce an 
                 polynomial-time algorithm for solving
                 the computational problem involved in 
                 this design, and we present results for

and such that no intermediate genome contains
a lethal gene. The main result of this paper is that, appropriately
formulated, this problem is undecidable, even when the underlying
alphabet has only 2 symbols (e.g. two of the bases A,C,G,T).
We prove that asexual evolutionary systems form a universal
computation engine, in the sense that for any
reversible
Turing machine M and input x, there is a finite set K of lethal genes,
which can guide the computation, so that all intermediate genomes
are prefixes of (encodings of) configurations in the computation of $M$.
Since reversible Turing machines retain the history of
their entire computation, and are essentially encoded by evolutionary systems,
this suggests a encoding mechanism by which phylogeny recapitulates ontogeny.

            first-order formulae obtained from a signature of binary and unary
            predicates called features and sorts, respectively.  We establish a
            first-order theory FT by means of three axiom schemes, show its
            completeness, and construct three elementarily equivalent models.
            
            One of the models consists of so-called feature graphs, a data structure
            common in computational linguistics.  The other two models consist of
            so-called feature trees, a record-like data structure generalizing the
            trees corresponding to first-order terms.
            
            Our completeness proof exhibits a terminating simplification system
            deciding validity and satisfiability of possibly quantified feature
            descriptions.}

            kind of sets.  Partial consistency checks can be made on these concept descriptions during the unification of feature terms.  Type checki

            The protein structure prediction problem is one of the most important
            problems in computational biology. This problem consists of finding
            the conformation of a protein (given by a sequence of amino-acids)
            with minimal energy. Because of the complexity of this problem,
            simplified models like Dill's HP-lattice model
            have become a major tool for investigating general properties of
            protein folding. Even for this simplified model, the structure
            prediction problem has been proven to be NP-complete.
            
            A disadvantage of the HP-problem is its high degeneracy. I.e., for
            every sequence there are a lot of conformations having the minimal
            energy. For this reason, extended alphabets have been used in the
            literature. One of these alphabets is the HPNX-alphabet, which
            considers hydrophobic amino acids as well as positive and negative
            charged ones.
            
            In this paper, we describe an exact algorithm for solving the
            structure prediction problem for the HPNX-alphabet.  To our knowledge,
            our algorithm is the first exact one for finding the minimal
            conformation of an lattice protein in a lattice model with an alphabet
            more complex than HP.  We also compare our results with results as
            given for the HP-model.}

abstract = {
            In many problems, non-determinism naturally arises in an concurrent
            constraint-based formulation in form of disjunctive constraints. To
            check consistency of disjunctive constraints, one needs to perform
            search by splitting the constraint store into local computation
            stores.  An important problem there is to eliminate symmetries, which
            give rise to many different but ''similar'' solutions found by the
            search procedure.  Since symmetries will give rise to an (often
            exponential) amplification of the search space, symmetry exclusion
            promises to efficiently prune the search tree.
            
            Hence, many constraint programmers have constructed mechanisms to
            exclude at least some of the symmetries of their
            problem. Unfortunately, symmetry exclusion was often not
            straightforward to implement and had to be redesigned for every
            special problem or enumeration strategy, which leaded to an
            inflexibility in the program structure once it was introduced. Often
            symmetry exclusion was not done at all or only for a small set of
            symmetries. In other cases, where symmetry exclusion was implemented
            it distracted the programmers attention from more important tasks.
            
            The contribution of our work is to give a generally applicable method
            for the exclusion of arbitrary symmetries. To our knowledge, this is
            the first general and declarative method for excluding symmetries in
            concurrent constraint programming.}

            the internal structure of both mRNA and ncRNA. Thus, 
            approaches can be distinguished into different major 
            categories depending on how they consider inter- and 
            intramolecular structure. The first class completely 
            neglects the internal structure and measures only the 
            stability of the duplex. The second class of approaches 
            abstracts from specific intramolecular structures and uses 
            an ensemble-based approach to calculate the effect of 
            internal structure on a putative binding site, thus 
            measuring the accessibility of the binding sites.Since 
            accessibility-based approaches can handle only one 
            continuous interaction site, two addition types of 
            approaches were introduced which predict a joint structure 
            for the interacting RNAs. Since this problem is NP-complete, 
            the approaches can handle only a restricted class of joint 
            structures. The first are co-folding approaches, which 
            predict a joint structure that is nested when the both 
            sequences are concatenated. The last and most complex class 
            of approaches impose only the restriction that they discard 
            zipper-like structures. Finally, we will discuss the use of 
            conservation information in RNA-target prediction.}

            selenocysteine requires an additional signal in form of a
            SECIS-element (\textbf{Se}leno\textbf{c}ysteine \textbf{I}nsertion
            \textbf{S}equence). This is an mRNA-motif, which is defined by both
            sequence-related and structure-related properties.
            
            The bioinformatics problem of interest is to design new selenoproteins
            (i.e., proteins containing  selenocysteine), since seleno variants of
            proteins are very useful in structure analysis. When designing
            new bacterial selenoproteins, one encounters the problem that 
            the SECIS-element itself is translated (and therefore encodes a
            subsequence of the complete protein). Hence, changes on the
            level of mRNA made in order to 
            generate a SECIS-element will also modify the amino acid
            sequence. Thus, one searches for an mRNA that is maximally similar to a
            SECIS-element, and for which the encoded amino acid sequence is
            maximally similar to the original amino acid sequence. In addition, it
            must satisfy the  constraints imposed by the structure. 
            
            Though the problem is NP-complete if arbitrary structural constraints are
            allowed, it can be solved efficiently when we consider the structures
            as used in SECIS-elements. The remaining 
            problem is to generate a description of the
            SECIS-element (and its diversity) based on the

            properties of proteins and principles of protein

            approaches to protein structure prediction. A well known
            protein model is the HPmodel of Lau and Dill [33], which
            models the important aspect of hydrophobicity. One can
            define the HP-model for various lattices, among them
            two-dimensional and three-dimensional ones. Here, we
            investigate the three-dimensional case. The main motivation
            for studying simplified protein models is to be able to
            predict model structures much more quickly and more
            accurately than is possible for real proteins. However, up
            to now there was a dilemma: the algorithmically tractable,
            simple protein models can not model real protein structures
            with good quality and introduce strong artifacts. <p> We
            present a constraint-based method that largely improves this
            situation. It outperforms all existing approaches for
            lattice protein folding in HP-models. This approach is the
            first one that can be applied to two three-dimensional
            lattices, namely the cubic lattice and the
            face-centered-cubic (FCC ) lattice. Moreover, it is the only
            exact method for the FCC lattice. The ability to use the FCC
            lattice is a significant improvement over the cubic
            lattice. The key to our approach is the ability to compute
            maximally compact sets of points (used as hydrophobic
            cores), which we accomplish for the first time for the FCC
            lattice. <p> Keywords: protein structure prediction,

            molecular biology; despite this interest fundamental
            algorithms are lacking, e.g. for identifying local
            motifs. As proteins, RNA molecules have a
            distinctive structure. Therefore, in addition to
            sequence information, structure plays an important
            part in assessing the similarity of
            RNAs. Furthermore, common sequence-structure
            features in two or several RNA molecules are often
            only spatially local, where possibly large parts of
            the molecules are dissimilar. Consequently, we
            address the problem of comparing RNA molecules by
            computing an optimal local alignment with respect to
            sequence and structure information. While local
            alignment is superior to global alignment for
            identifying local similarities, no general local
            sequence-structure alignment algorithms are
            currently known. We suggest a new general definition
            of locality for sequence-structure alignments that
            is biologically motivated and efficiently
            tractable. To show the former, we discuss locality
            of RNA and prove that the defined locality means
            connectivity by atomic and non-atomic bonds. To show
            the latter, we present an efficient algorithm for
            the newly defined pairwise local sequence-structure
            alignment (lssa) problem for RNA. For molecules of

            specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) are widely used to 
            represent sequence motifs in nucleotide as well as amino 
            acid sequences. Searching with PSSMs in complete genomes or 
            large sequence databases is a common, but computationally 
            expensive task. RESULTS: We present a new non-heuristic 
            algorithm, called ESAsearch, to efficiently find matches of 
            PSSMs in large databases. Our approach preprocesses the 
            search space, e.g., a complete genome or a set of protein 
            sequences, and builds an enhanced suffix array that is 
            stored on file. This allows the searching of a database with 
            a PSSM in sublinear expected time. Since ESAsearch benefits 
            from small alphabets, we present a variant operating on 
            sequences recoded according to a reduced alphabet. We also 
            address the problem of non-comparable PSSM-scores by 
            developing a method which allows the efficient computation 
            of a matrix similarity threshold for a PSSM, given an 
            E-value or a p-value. Our method is based on dynamic 
            programming and, in contrast to other methods, it employs 
            lazy evaluation of the dynamic programming matrix. We 
            evaluated algorithm ESAsearch with nucleotide PSSMs and with 
            amino acid PSSMs. Compared to the best previous methods, 
            ESAsearch shows speedups of a factor between 17 and 275 for 
            nucleotide PSSMs, and speedups up to factor 1.8 for amino 
            acid PSSMs. Comparisons with the most widely used programs 
            even show speedups by a factor of at least 3.8. Alphabet 
            reduction yields an additional speedup factor of 2 on amino 
            acid sequences compared to results achieved with the 20 
            symbol standard alphabet. The lazy evaluation method is also 
            much faster than previous methods, with speedups of a factor 
            between 3 and 330. CONCLUSION: Our analysis of ESAsearch 
            reveals sublinear runtime in the expected case, and linear 
            runtime in the worst case for sequences not shorter than the 
            absolute value of A(m) + m - 1, where m is the length of the 
            PSSM and A a finite alphabet. In practice, ESAsearch shows 
            superior performance over the most widely used programs, 
            especially for DNA sequences. The new algorithm for accurate 
            on-the-fly calculations of thresholds has the potential to 
            replace formerly used approximation approaches. Beyond the 
            algorithmic contributions, we provide a robust, well 
            documented, and easy to use software package, implementing 
            the ideas and algorithms presented in this manuscript.}

abstract = {We studied intra-annual wood density profiles of Douglas-fir tree rings (Pseudotsuga menziesii
            [Mirb.] Franco) in southwestern Germany. Growth rate varies differently over time throughout the
            circumference of trees. This leads to differences in wood formation, which can be observed in the
            shape of the density profiles of the same tree ring measured in different radial directions. Due to this
            spatial variation in density profiles, we need a reliable method to determine an average profile,
            which preserves the common characteristics of the data. To this end, we developed a multiple
            interval-based curve alignment (MICA) procedure. It identifies characteristic points within the
            profiles such as minima, maxima and inflection points. These reference points are shifted gradually
            against each other within a proportionally defined base line interval. Using our progressive alignment
            approach, we are able to calculate an average profile that represents very well the characteristics of
            all measured curves of a specific tree ring. We applied the procedure to get year-specific average
            profiles using various trees. This results in representative mean density profiles that preserves the
            density variations common to all aligned profiles. Individual noise is reduced thereby enabling the
            analysis of the impact of weather variations on wood density.}

abstract = {Background: The prediction of a consensus structure
            for a set of related RNAs is an important first step
            for subsequent analyses. RNAalifold, which computes
            the minimum energy structure that is simultaneously
            formed by a set of aligned sequences, is one of the
            oldest and most widely used tools for this task. In
            recent years, several alternative approaches have
            been advocated, pointing to several shortcomings of
            the original RNAalifold approach.  Results: We show
            that the accuracy of RNAalifold predictions can be
            improved substantially by introducing a different,
            more rational handling of alignment gaps, and by
            replacing the rather simplistic model of covariance
            scoring with more sophisticated RIBOSUM-like scoring
            matrices. These improvements are achieved without
            compromising the computational efficiency of the
            algorithm. We show here that the new version of
            RNAalifold not only outperforms the old one, but
            also several other tools recently developed, on
            different datasets.  Conclusions: The new version of
            RNAalifold not only can replace the old one for
            almost any application but it is also competitive
            with other approaches including those based on
            SCFGs, maximum expected accuracy, or hierarchical
            nearest neighbor classifiers.}

            metastable conformations plays an important role in cellular processes. In order to identify such molecules and to predict their conformational
            changes one has to investigate the refolding pathways. As a qualitative measure of these transitions, the barrier height
            marks the energy peak along such refolding paths. We introduce a
            meta-heuristic to estimate such barriers, which is an NP-complete
            problem. To guide an arbitrary path heuristic, the method uses
            RNA shape representative structures as intermediate checkpoints
            for detours. This enables a broad but estimationcient search for refolding
            pathways. The resulting Shape Triples meta-heuristic enables
            a close to optimal estimation of the barrier height that outperforms
            the precision of the employed path heuristic.}

            elements. A plethora of CRISPR-Cas versions exist, with more 
            than 40 different Cas protein families and several different 
            molecular approaches to fight the invading DNA. One of the 
            key players in the system is the crRNA, which directs the 
            invader - degrading Cas protein complex to the invader. The 
            CRISPR-Cas types I and III use the Cas6 protein to generate 
            mature crRNAs. Here, we show that the Cas6 protein is 
            necessary for crRNA production but that additional Cas 
            proteins that form a Cascade-like complex are needed for 
            crRNA stability in the CRISPR-Cas type I-B system in

            production and stability is rescued only if cas5, 6 and 7

            three amino acids (His41, Gly256 and Gly258) that are 
            essential for pre-crRNA cleavage, while the mutation of two 
            amino acids (Ser115 and Ser224) leads to an increase of 
            crRNA amounts. This is the first systematic in vivo analysis 
            of Cas6 protein variants. In addition, we show that the H. 
            volcanii I-B system contains a Cascade-like complex with a 
            Cas7, Cas5 and Cas6 core that protects the crRNA.}

            contribute to the pathomechanisms of motoneuron diseases 
            such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular 
            atrophy. RNA-binding proteins are involved in these 
            processes, but the mechanisms by which they regulate the 
            subcellular diversity of transcriptomes, particularly in 
            axons, are not understood. Heterogeneous nuclear 
            ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R) interacts with several 
            proteins involved in motoneuron diseases. It is located in 
            axons of developing motoneurons, and its depletion causes 
            defects in axon growth. Here, we used individual 
            nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation 
            (iCLIP) to determine the RNA interactome of hnRNP R in 
            motoneurons. We identified approximately 3,500 RNA targets, 
            predominantly with functions in synaptic transmission and 
            axon guidance. Among the RNA targets identified by iCLIP, 
            the noncoding RNA 7SK was the top interactor of hnRNP R. We 
            detected 7SK in the nucleus and also in the cytosol of 
            motoneurons. In axons, 7SK localized in close proximity to 
            hnRNP R, and depletion of hnRNP R reduced axonal 7SK. 
            Furthermore, suppression of 7SK led to defective axon growth 
            that was accompanied by axonal transcriptome alterations 
            similar to those caused by hnRNP R depletion. Using a series 
            of 7SK-deletion mutants, we show that the function of 7SK in 
            axon elongation depends on its interaction with hnRNP R but 
            not with the PTEF-B complex involved in transcriptional 
            regulation. These results propose a role for 7SK as an 
            essential interactor of hnRNP R to regulate its function in 
            axon maintenance.}

            sequences that fold into a given structure. RESULTS: We 
            introduce a new algorithm for the inverse folding problem 
            (INFO-RNA) that consists of two parts; a dynamic programming 
            method for good initial sequences and a following improved 
            stochastic local search that uses an effective neighbor 
            selection method. During the initialization, we design a 
            sequence that among all sequences adopts the given structure 
            with the lowest possible energy. For the selection of 
            neighbors during the search, we use a kind of look-ahead of 
            one selection step applying an additional energy-based 
            criterion. Afterwards, the pre-ordered neighbors are tested 
            using the actual optimization criterion of minimizing the

            already been identified, but the number of experimentally

            computational target prediction is in great demand. Many

abstract = {Recent interests, such as RNA interference and antisense 
            RNA regulation, strongly motivate the problem of predicting 
            whether two nucleic acid strands interact. MOTIVATION: 
            Regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNAs play 
            an important role in gene regulation. Studies on both 
            prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells show that such ncRNAs 
            usually bind to their target mRNA to regulate the 
            translation of corresponding genes. The specificity of these 
            interactions depends on the stability of intermolecular and 
            intramolecular base pairing. While methods like deep 
            sequencing allow to discover an ever increasing set of 
            ncRNAs, there are no high-throughput methods available to 
            detect their associated targets. Hence, there is an 
            increasing need for precise computational target prediction. 
            In order to predict base-pairing probability of any two 
            bases in interacting nucleic acids, it is necessary to 
            compute the interaction partition function over the whole 
            ensemble. The partition function is a scalar value from 
            which various thermodynamic quantities can be derived. For 
            example, the equilibrium concentration of each complex 
            nucleic acid species and also the melting temperature of 
            interacting nucleic acids can be calculated based on the 
            partition function of the complex. RESULTS: We present a 
            model for analyzing the thermodynamics of two interacting 
            nucleic acid strands considering the most general type of 
            interactions studied in the literature. We also present a 
            corresponding dynamic programming algorithm that computes 
            the partition function over (almost) all physically possible 
            joint secondary structures formed by two interacting nucleic 
            acids in O(n(6)) time. We verify the predictive power of our 
            algorithm by computing (i) the melting temperature for 
            interacting RNA pairs studied in the literature and (ii) the 
            equilibrium concentration for several variants of the 
            OxyS-fhlA complex. In both experiments, our algorithm shows 
            high accuracy and outperforms competitors. AVAILABILITY:

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomes are trematode parasites of the 
            phylum Platyhelminthes. They are considered the most 
            important of the human helminth parasites in terms of 
            morbidity and mortality. Draft genome sequences are now 
            available for Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum. 
            Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) plays a crucial role in gene 
            expression regulation, cellular function and defense, 
            homeostasis, and pathogenesis. The genome-wide annotation of 
            ncRNAs is a non-trivial task unless well-annotated genomes 
            of closely related species are already available. RESULTS: A 
            homology search for structured ncRNA in the genome of S. 
            mansoni resulted in 23 types of ncRNAs with conserved 
            primary and secondary structure. Among these, we identified 
            rRNA, snRNA, SL RNA, SRP, tRNAs and RNase P, and also 
            possibly MRP and 7SK RNAs. In addition, we confirmed five 
            miRNAs that have recently been reported in S. japonicum and 
            found two additional homologs of known miRNAs. The tRNA 
            complement of S. mansoni is comparable to that of the 
            free-living planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, although for 
            some amino acids differences of more than a factor of two 
            are observed: Leu, Ser, and His are overrepresented, while 
            Cys, Meth, and Ile are underrepresented in S. mansoni. On 
            the other hand, the number of tRNAs in the genome of S. 
            japonicum is reduced by more than a factor of four. Both 
            schistosomes have a complete set of minor spliceosomal 
            snRNAs. Several ncRNAs that are expected to exist in the S. 
            mansoni genome were not found, among them the telomerase 
            RNA, vault RNAs, and Y RNAs. CONCLUSION: The ncRNA sequences 
            and structures presented here represent the most complete 
            dataset of ncRNA from any lophotrochozoan reported so far. 
            This data set provides an important reference for further 
            analysis of the genomes of schistosomes and indeed 
            eukaryotic genomes at large.}

            Biology. It can be reasonably abstracted as a

            depends on the distances between the various
            amino-acids composing the protein and on their
            types. Even with strong approximations, the problem
            is shown to be computationally intractable. However,
            the solution of the problem for an arbitrary input
            size is not needed. Solutions for proteins of length
            100-200 would give a strong contribution to
            Biotechnology. In this paper, we tackle the problem
            with constraint-based methods, using additional

abstract = {L7Ae is a universal archaeal protein that recognizes and 
            stabilizes kink-turn (k-turn) motifs in RNA substrates. 
            These structural motifs are widespread in nature and are 
            found in many functional RNA species, including ribosomal 
            RNAs. Synthetic biology approaches utilize L7Ae/k-turn 
            interactions to control gene expression in eukaryotes. Here, 
            we present results of comprehensive RNA immunoprecipitation 
            sequencing (RIP-Seq) analysis of genomically tagged L7Ae 
            from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus 
            acidocaldarius A large set of interacting noncoding RNAs was 
            identified. In addition, several mRNAs, including the l7ae 
            transcript, were found to contain k-turn motifs that 
            facilitate L7Ae binding. In vivo studies showed that L7Ae 
            autoregulates the translation of its mRNA by binding to a 
            k-turn motif present in the 5' untranslated region (UTR). A 
            green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system was 
            established in Escherichia coli and verified conservation of 
            L7Ae-mediated feedback regulation in Archaea Mobility shift 
            assays confirmed binding to a k-turn in the transcript of 
            nop5-fibrillarin, suggesting that the expression of all C/D 
            box sRNP core proteins is regulated by L7Ae. These studies 
            revealed that L7Ae-mediated gene regulation evolved in 
            archaeal organisms, generating new tools for the modulation 
            of synthetic gene circuits in bacteria.IMPORTANCE L7Ae is an 
            essential archaeal protein that is known to structure 
            ribosomal RNAs and small RNAs (sRNAs) by binding to their 
            kink-turn motifs. Here, we utilized RIP-Seq methodology to 
            achieve a first global analysis of RNA substrates for L7Ae. 
            Several novel interactions with noncoding RNA molecules 
            (e.g., with the universal signal recognition particle RNA) 
            were discovered. In addition, L7Ae was found to bind to 
            mRNAs, including its own transcript's 5' untranslated 
            region. This feedback-loop control is conserved in most 
            archaea and was incorporated into a reporter system that was 
            utilized to control gene expression in bacteria. These 
            results demonstrate that L7Ae-mediated gene regulation 
            evolved originally in archaeal organisms. The 
            feedback-controlled reporter gene system can easily be 
            adapted for synthetic biology approaches that require strict 
            gene expression control.}

            metaMIR, a combinatorial approach to identify miRNAs that

            list. We based metaMIR predictions on an improved dataset of 
            human miRNA-target interactions, compiled using a 
            machine-learning-based meta-analysis of established 
            algorithms. Simultaneously, the inverse dataset of negative 
            interactions not likely to occur was extracted to increase 
            classifier performance, as measured using an expansive set 
            of experimentally validated interactions from a variety of 
            sources. In a second differential mode, candidate miRNAs are 
            predicted by indicating genes to be targeted and others to 
            be avoided to potentially increase specificity of results. 
            As an example, we investigate the neural crest, a transient 
            structure in vertebrate development where miRNAs play a 
            pivotal role. Patterns of metaMIR-predicted miRNA regulation 
            alone partially recapitulated functional relationships among 
            genes, and separate differential analysis revealed miRNA 
            candidates that would downregulate components implicated in 
            cancer progression while not targeting tumour suppressors. 
            Such an approach could aid in therapeutic application of 
            miRNAs to reduce unintended effects. The utility is

abstract = {Motivation:
            The folding dynamics of RNAs are typically studied via coarse-grained models of the underlying energy landscape to face the exponential growths of the RNA secondary structure space.
            Still, studies of exact folding kinetics based on gradient basin abstractions are currently limited to short sequence lengths due to vast memory requirements.
            In order to compute exact transition rates between gradient basins, state-of-the-art approaches apply global flooding schemes that require to memorize the whole structure space at once.
            pourRNA tackles this problem via local flooding techniques where memorization is limited to the structure ensembles of individual gradient basins.
            Results:
            Compared to the only available tool for exact gradient basin based macro state transition rates (namely barriers), pourRNA computes the same exact transition rates up to ten times faster and requires two orders of magnitude less memory for sequences that are still computationally accessible for
            exhaustive enumeration.
            Parallelized computation as well as additional heuristics further speed up computations while still producing high quality transition model approximations.
            The introduced heuristics enable a guided trade-off between model quality and required computational resources.
            We introduce and evaluate a macroscopic direct-path heuristics to efficiently compute refolding energy barrier estimations for the co-transcriptionally trapped RNA sv11 of length 115nt.
            Finally, we also show how pourRNA can be used to identify folding funnels and their respective energetically lowest minima.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data-independent acquisition (DIA) has become 
            an important approach in global, mass spectrometric 
            proteomic studies because it provides in-depth insights into 
            the molecular variety of biological systems. However, DIA 
            data analysis remains challenging owing to the high 
            complexity and large data and sample size, which require 
            specialized software and vast computing infrastructures. 
            Most available open-source DIA software necessitates basic 
            programming skills and covers only a fraction of a complete 
            DIA data analysis. In consequence, DIA data analysis often 
            requires usage of multiple software tools and compatibility 
            thereof, severely limiting the usability and 
            reproducibility. FINDINGS: To overcome this hurdle, we have 
            integrated a suite of open-source DIA tools in the Galaxy 
            framework for reproducible and version-controlled data 
            processing. The DIA suite includes OpenSwath, PyProphet, 
            diapysef, and swath2stats. We have compiled functional 
            Galaxy pipelines for DIA processing, which provide a 
            web-based graphical user interface to these pre-installed 
            and pre-configured tools for their use on freely accessible, 
            powerful computational resources of the Galaxy framework. 
            This approach also enables seamless sharing workflows with 
            full configuration in addition to sharing raw data and 
            results. We demonstrate the usability of an all-in-one DIA 
            pipeline in Galaxy by the analysis of a spike-in case study 
            dataset. Additionally, extensive training material is 
            provided to further increase access for the proteomics 
            community. CONCLUSION: The integration of an open-source DIA 
            analysis suite in the web-based and user-friendly Galaxy 
            framework in combination with extensive training material 
            empowers a broad community of researches to perform 
            reproducible and transparent DIA data analysis.}

abstract = {RNA has become one of the major research topics in 
            molecular biology. As a central player in key processes 
            regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many 
            efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition 
            of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more 
            and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly 
            growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that 
            cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, 
            increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of 
            experiments, addressing different aspects of biological 
            questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a 
            single framework. Only then is it possible to connect 
            findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. 
            target predictions. To address these needs, we present the 
            RNA Workbench 2.0 , an updated online resource for RNA 
            related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a 
            comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that 
            enables researchers to analyze their data without the need 
            for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the 
            established framework to the next level, providing not only 
            a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a 
            ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data 
            exploration, and visualization. The new framework is 
            available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu , and login is free

            emergence of tissue identity during development, yet the 
            role of this process in malignant transformation is 
            undefined. Tissue-specific splicing involves evolutionarily 
            conserved, alternative exons that represent only a minority 
            of the total alternative exons identified. Many of these 
            conserved exons have functional features that influence 
            signaling pathways to profound biological effect. Here, we 
            determined that lineage-specific splicing of a 
            brain-enriched cassette exon in the membrane-binding tumor 
            suppressor annexin A7 (ANXA7) diminishes endosomal targeting 
            of the EGFR oncoprotein, consequently enhancing EGFR 
            signaling during brain tumor progression. ANXA7 exon 
            splicing was mediated by the ribonucleoprotein PTBP1, which 
            is normally repressed during neuronal development. PTBP1 was 
            highly expressed in glioblastomas due to loss of a 
            brain-enriched microRNA (miR-124) and to PTBP1 
            amplification. The alternative ANXA7 splicing trait was 
            present in precursor cells, suggesting that glioblastoma 
            cells inherit the trait from a potential tumor-initiating 
            ancestor and that these cells exploit this trait through 
            accumulation of mutations that enhance EGFR signaling. Our 
            data illustrate that lineage-specific splicing of a 
            tissue-regulated alternative exon in a constituent of an 
            oncogenic pathway eliminates tumor suppressor functions and 
            promotes glioblastoma progression. This paradigm may offer a 
            general model as to how tissue-specific regulatory 
            mechanisms can reprogram normal developmental processes into 
            oncogenic ones.}

Several competing hypotheses for the evolutionary mechanisms that shape metabolic networks have been discussed in the literature, each of which finds support from comparative analysis of extant genomes. Alternatively, the principles of metabolic evolution can be studied by direct computer simulation. This requires, however, an explicit implementation of all pertinent components: a universe of chemical reaction upon which the metabolism is built, an explicit representation of the enzymes that implement the metabolism, of a genetic system that encodes these enzymes, and of a fitness function that can be selected for. Results: We describe here a simulation environment that implements all these components in a simplified ways so that large-scale evolutionary studies are feasible. We employ an artificial chemistry that views chemical reactions as graph rewriting operations and utilizes a toy-version of quantum chemistry to derive thermodynamic parameters. Minimalist organisms with simple string encoded genomes produce model ribozymes whose catalytic activity is determined by an ad hoc mapping between their secondary structure and the transition state graphs that they stabilize. Fitness is computed utilizing the ideas of metabolic flux analysis. We present an implementation of the complete system and first simulation results. Conclusions: The simulation system presented here allows coherent investigations into the evolutionary mechanisms of the first steps of metabolic evolution using a self-consistent toy universe.}

abstract = {Motivation: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as 
            transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not get 
            translated into proteins. Often these transcripts are 
            processed (spliced, capped, polyadenylated) and some are 
            known to have important biological functions. However, most 
            lncRNAs have unknown or poorly understood functions. 
            Nevertheless, because of their potential role in cancer, 
            lncRNAs are receiving a lot of attention, and the need for 
            computational tools to predict their possible mechanisms of 
            action is more than ever. Fundamentally, most of the known 
            lncRNA mechanisms involve RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein 
            interactions. Through accurate predictions of each kind of 
            interaction and integration of these predictions, it is 
            possible to elucidate potential mechanisms for a given 
            lncRNA. Approach: Here we introduce MechRNA, a pipeline for 
            corroborating RNA-RNA interaction prediction and protein 
            binding prediction for identifying possible lncRNA 
            mechanisms involving specific targets or on a 
            transcriptome-wide scale. The first stage uses a version of 
            IntaRNA2 with added functionality for efficient prediction 
            of RNA-RNA interactions with very long input sequences, 
            allowing for large-scale analysis of lncRNA interactions 
            with little or no loss of optimality. The second stage 
            integrates protein binding information pre-computed by 
            GraphProt, for both the lncRNA and the target. The final 
            stage involves inferring the most likely mechanism for each 
            lncRNA/target pair. This is achieved by generating candidate 
            mechanisms from the predicted interactions, the relative 
            locations of these interactions and correlation data, 
            followed by selection of the most likely mechanistic 
            explanation using a combined p-value. Results: We applied 
            MechRNA on a number of recently identified cancer-related 
            lncRNAs (PCAT1, PCAT29, ARLnc1) and also on two well-studied 
            lncRNAs (PCA3 and 7SL). This led to the identification of 
            hundreds of high confidence potential targets for each 
            lncRNA and corresponding mechanisms. These predictions 
            include the known competitive mechanism of 7SL with HuR for 
            binding on the tumor suppressor TP53, as well as mechanisms 
            expanding what is known about PCAT1 and ARLn1 and their 
            targets BRCA2 and AR, respectively. For PCAT1-BRCA2, the 
            mechanism involves competitive binding with HuR, which we 
            confirmed using HuR immunoprecipitation assays.

abstract = {Efficient computational tools for the identification of putative target RNAs regulated by prokaryotic sRNAs rely on thermodynamic models of RNA secondary structures.
            While they typically predict RNA-RNA interaction complexes accurately, they yield many highly-ranked false positives in target screens.
            One obvious source of this low specificity appears to be the disability of current secondary-structure-based models to reflect steric constraints, which nevertheless govern the kinetic formation of RNA-RNA interactions. 
            For example, often- even thermodynamically favorable -extensions of short initial kissing hairpin interactions are kinetically prohibited, since this would require unwinding of intra-molecular helices as well as sterically impossible bending of the interaction helix.
            Another source is the consideration of instable and thus unlikely subinteractions that enable better scoring of longer interactions.
            In consequence, the efficient prediction methods that do not consider such effects show a high false positive rate.
            To increase the prediction accuracy we devise IntaRNAhelix, a dynamic programming algorithm that length-restricts the runs of consecutive inter-molecular base pairs (perfect canonical stackings), which we hypothesize to implicitely model the steric and kinetic effects. The novel method is implemented by extending the state-of-the-art tool IntaRNA.
            Our comprehensive bacterial sRNA target prediction benchmark demonstrates significant improvements of the prediction accuracy and enables more than 40-times faster computations. These results indicate- supporting our hypothesis -that stable helix composition increases the accuracy of interaction prediction models compared to the current state-of-the-art approach.}

abstract = {Efficient computational tools for the identification of putative target RNAs regulated by prokaryotic sRNAs
            rely on thermodynamic models of RNA secondary structures.  While they typically predict RNA-RNA in-
            teraction complexes accurately, they yield many highly-ranked false positives in target screens.  One obvious
            source of this low specificity appears to be the disability of current secondary-structure-based models to reflect
            steric constraints, which nevertheless govern the kinetic formation of RNA-RNA interactions.  For example,
            often?even thermodynamically favorable?extensions of short initial kissing hairpin interactions are kineti-
            cally prohibited, since this would require unwinding of intra-molecular helices as well as sterically impossible
            bending of the interaction helix. In consequence, the efficient prediction methods, which do not consider such
            effects,  predict over-long helices.  To increase the prediction accuracy,  we devise a dynamic programming
            algorithm that length-restricts the runs of consecutive inter-molecular base pairs (perfect canonical stackings),
            which we hypothesize to implicitely model the steric and kinetic effects. The novel method is implemented by
            extending the state-of-the-art tool IntaRNA. Our comprehensive bacterial sRNA target prediction benchmark
            demonstrates significant improvements of the prediction accuracy and enables 3-4 times faster computations.
            These results indicate?supporting our hypothesis?that length-limitations on inter-molecular subhelices in-
            crease the accuracy of interaction prediction models compared to the current state-of-the-art approach.}

abstract = {Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of 
            gene expression. The functional and evolutionary characterization of sRNAs 
            requires the identification of homologs, which is frequently challenging due 
            to their heterogeneity, short length and partly, little sequence conservation. 
            We developed the GLobal Automatic Small RNA Search go (GLASSgo) algorithm to 
            identify sRNA homologs in complex genomic databases starting from a single 
            sequence. GLASSgo combines an iterative BLAST strategy with pairwise identity 
            filtering and a graph-based clustering method that utilizes RNA secondary 
            structure information. We tested the specificity, sensitivity and runtime of 
            GLASSgo, BLAST and the combination RNAlien/cmsearch in a typical use case 
            scenario on 40 bacterial sRNA families. The sensitivity of the tested methods 
            was similar, while the specificity of GLASSgo and RNAlien/cmsearch was 
            significantly higher than that of BLAST. GLASSgo was on average about 87 times 
            faster than RNAlien/cmsearch, and only about 7.5 times slower than BLAST, 
            which shows that GLASSgo optimizes the trade-off between speed and accuracy in 
            the task of finding sRNA homologs. GLASSgo is fully automated, whereas BLAST 
            often recovers only parts of homologs and RNAlien/cmsearch requires extensive 
            additional bioinformatic work to get a comprehensive set of homologs. GLASSgo 
            is available as an easy-to-use web server to find homologous sRNAs in large 
            databases.}

            function for the organism throughout life. The significance 
            of DNA methylation in shaping the phenotype of the heart

            identify large genomic regions that are differentially

            Demethylation of cardiomyocyte gene bodies correlates 
            strongly with increased gene expression. Silencing of 
            demethylated genes is characterized by the polycomb mark 
            H3K27me3 or by DNA methylation. De novo methylation by DNA 
            methyltransferases 3A/B causes repression of fetal cardiac

                  inference problem either for pedigrees or for
                  unrelatedindividuals.  This work integrates two
                  relevant and well-known constraint based haplotyping
                  approaches. The Minimum Recombinant Haplotyping
                  Configuration (MRHC)problem targets the haplotyping
                  solution which minimizes the number of recombinant
                  events within a pedigree. MRHC only takes into
                  consideration the family information.In contrast,
                  the Haplotype Inference by Pure Parsimony (HIPP)
                  problem aims at finding a solution which minimizes
                  the number of distinct haplotypes. The HIPP
                  approachis adequate for phasing unrelated
                  individuals from the same population. This paper
                  proposes a method for inferring haplotypes for
                  individuals of the same population,although
                  organized in different families, thus combining both
                  MRHC and HIPP approaches.  This new method can take
                  into account family information and
                  populationinformation, both important in haplotype
                  inference.  Experimental results show that the
                  proposed approach is more accurate, both in terms of
                  switch error rate and miss-ing error rate, than the

abstract = {In contrast to extensively studied prokaryotic 'small' 
            transcriptomes (encompassing all small noncoding RNAs), 
            small proteomes (here defined as including proteins </=70 
            aa) are only now entering the limelight. The absence of a 
            complete small protein catalogue in most prokaryotes 
            precludes our understanding of how these molecules affect 
            physiology. So far, archaeal genomes have not yet been 
            analyzed broadly with a dedicated focus on small proteins. 
            Here, we present a combinatorial approach, integrating 
            experimental data from small protein-optimized mass 
            spectrometry (MS) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq), to 
            generate a high confidence inventory of small proteins in 
            the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. We demonstrate by MS 
            and Ribo-seq that 67% of the 317 annotated small open 
            reading frames (sORFs) are translated under standard growth 
            conditions. Furthermore, annotation-independent analysis of 
            Ribo-seq data showed ribosomal engagement for 47 novel sORFs 
            in intergenic regions. A total of seven of these were also 
            detected by proteomics, in addition to an eighth novel small 
            protein solely identified by MS. We also provide independent 
            experimental evidence in vivo for the translation of 12 
            sORFs (annotated and novel) using epitope tagging and 
            western blotting, underlining the validity of our 
            identification scheme. Several novel sORFs are conserved in 
            Haloferax species and might have important functions. Based 
            on our findings, we conclude that the small proteome of H. 
            volcanii is larger than previously appreciated, and that 
            combining MS with Ribo-seq is a powerful approach for the 
            discovery of novel small protein coding genes in archaea.}

abstract = {The soil-dwelling plant symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti is 
            a major model organism of Alphaproteobacteria. Despite 
            numerous detailed OMICS studies, information about small 
            open reading frame (sORF)-encoded proteins (SEPs) is largely 
            missing, because sORFs are poorly annotated and SEPs are 
            hard to detect experimentally. However, given that SEPs can 
            fulfill important functions, identification of translated 
            sORFs is critical for analyzing their roles in bacterial 
            physiology. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) can detect 
            translated sORFs with high sensitivity, but is not yet 
            routinely applied to bacteria because it must be adapted for 
            each species. Here, we established a Ribo-seq procedure for 
            S. meliloti 2011 based on RNase I digestion and detected 
            translation for 60% of the annotated coding sequences during 
            growth in minimal medium. Using ORF prediction tools based 
            on Ribo-seq data, subsequent filtering, and manual curation, 
            the translation of 37 non-annotated sORFs with </= 70 amino 
            acids was predicted with confidence. The Ribo-seq data were 
            supplemented by mass spectrometry (MS) analyses from three 
            sample preparation approaches and two integrated 
            proteogenomic search database (iPtgxDB) types. Searches 
            against standard and 20-fold smaller Ribo-seq data-informed 
            custom iPtgxDBs confirmed 47 annotated SEPs and identified 
            11 additional novel SEPs. Epitope tagging and Western blot 
            analysis confirmed the translation of 15 out of 20 SEPs 
            selected from the translatome map. Overall, by combining MS 
            and Ribo-seq approaches, the small proteome of S. meliloti 
            was substantially expanded by 48 novel SEPs. Several of them 
            are part of predicted operons and/or are conserved from 
            Rhizobiaceae to Bacteria, suggesting important physiological 
            functions.}

            is a common task in the data analysis of methods such as 
            cross-linking immunoprecipitation in combination with 
            high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq). The predicted binding 
            sites are often further analyzed to predict sequence motifs 
            or structure patterns. When looking at a typical result of 
            such high-throughput experiments, the obtained peak profiles 
            differ largely on a genomic level. Thus, a tool is missing 
            that evaluates and classifies the predicted peaks on the 
            basis of their shapes. We hereby present StoatyDive, a tool 
            that can be used to filter for specific peak profile shapes 
            of sequencing data such as CLIP. FINDINGS: With StoatyDive 
            we are able to classify peak profile shapes from CLIP-seq 
            data of the histone stem-loop-binding protein (SLBP). We 
            compare the results to existing tools and show that 
            StoatyDive finds more distinct peak shape clusters for CLIP 
            data. Furthermore, we present StoatyDive's capabilities as a 
            quality control tool and as a filter to pick different 
            shapes based on biological or technical questions for other 
            CLIP data from different RNA binding proteins with different 
            biological functions and numbers of RNA recognition motifs. 
            We finally show that proteins involved in splicing, such as 
            RBM22 and U2AF1, have potentially sharper-shaped peaks than 
            other RNA binding proteins. CONCLUSION: StoatyDive finally 
            fills the demand for a peak shape clustering tool for 
            CLIP-Seq data that fine-tunes downstream analysis steps such 
            as structure or sequence motif predictions and that acts as 
            a quality control.}

            amoebae and ciliated protozoa which are the natural hosts for Legionella

            MOTIVATION: Specific functions of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules are often 
            associated with different motifs in the RNA structure. The key feature that 
            forms such an RNA motif is the combination of sequence and structure 
            properties. In this article, we introduce a new RNA sequence-structure 
            comparison method which maintains exact matching substructures. Existing 
            common substructures are treated as whole unit while variability is allowed 
            between such structural motifs. Based on a fast detectable set of overlapping 
            and crossing substructure matches for two nested RNA secondary structures, 
            our method ExpaRNA (exact pattern of alignment of RNA) computes the longest 
            collinear sequence of substructures common to two RNAs in O(H*nm) time and 
            O(nm) space, where H << n.m for real RNA structures. Applied to different 
            RNAs, our method correctly identifies sequence-structure similarities between
            two RNAs. 
            
            RESULTS: We have compared ExpaRNA with two other alignment methods
            that work with given RNA structures, namely RNAforester and RNA_align. The 
            results are in good agreement, but can be obtained in a fraction of running
            time, in particular for larger RNAs. We have also used ExpaRNA to speed up 
            state-of-the-art Sankoff-style alignment tools like LocARNA, and observe a
            tradeoff between quality and speed. However, we get a speedup of 4.25 even
            in the highest quality setting, where the quality of the produced 
            alignment is comparable to that of LocARNA alone. 
            
            AVAILABILITY: The presented algorithm is implemented in the program ExpaRNA, which is

abstract = {The secondary structure of a pre-mRNA influences a number 
            of processing steps including alternative splicing. Since 
            most splicing regulatory proteins bind to single-stranded 
            RNA, the sequestration of RNA into double strands could 
            prevent their binding. Here, we analyzed the secondary 
            structure context of experimentally determined splicing 
            enhancer and silencer motifs in their natural pre-mRNA 
            context. We found that these splicing motifs are 
            significantly more single-stranded than controls. These 
            findings were validated by transfection experiments, where 
            the effect of enhancer or silencer motifs on exon skipping 
            was much more pronounced in single-stranded conformation. We 
            also found that the structural context of predicted splicing 
            motifs is under selection, suggesting a general importance 
            of secondary structures on splicing and adding another level 
            of evolutionary constraints on pre-mRNAs. Our results 
            explain the action of mutations that affect splicing and 
            indicate that the structural context of splicing motifs is

abstract = {Many alternative splice events result in subtle mRNA
            changes, and most of them occur at short-distance tandem
            donor and acceptor sites. The splicing mechanism of such
            tandem sites likely involves the stochastic selection of
            either splice site. While tandem splice events are frequent,
            it is unknown how many are functionally important. Here, we
            use phylogenetic conservation to address this question,
            focusing on tandems with a distance of 3-9 nucleotides. We
            show that previous contradicting results on whether
            alternative or constitutive tandem motifs are more conserved
            between species can be explained by a statistical paradox
            (Simpson's paradox). Applying methods that take biases into
            account, we found higher conservation of alternative tandems
            in mouse, dog, and even chicken, zebrafish, and Fugu
            genomes. We estimated a lower bound for the number of
            alternative sites that are under purifying (negative)
            selection. While the absolute number of conserved tandem
            motifs decreases with the evolutionary distance, the
            fraction under selection increases. Interestingly, a number
            of frameshifting tandems are under selection, suggesting a
            role in regulating mRNA and protein levels via
            nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). An analysis of the intronic
            flanks shows that purifying selection also acts on the
            intronic sequence. We propose that stochastic splice site
            selection can be an advantageous mechanism that allows
            constant splice variant ratios in situations where a
            deviation in this ratio is deleterious.}

            multiple lines of evidence that the human protein coding
            sequences are under selection against such in-frame tandem
            splice events, indicating that these events are often

            within the coding sequence as protein regions that fold into
            a fixed 3D structure (intrinsically ordered) are under
            stronger selection, especially against sites with a strong
            minor splice site. Investigating structures of functional
            protein domains, we found that tandem acceptors are

            mature mRNAs from one precursor. New findings
            indicate that alternative splicing occurs much more
            often than previously assumed. A major goal of
            functional genomics lies in elucidating and
            characterizing the entire spectrum of alternative
            splice forms. Existing approaches such as
            EST-alignments focus only on the mRNA sequence to
            detect alternative splice forms. They do not
            consider function and characteristics of the
            resulting proteins. One important example of such
            functional characterization is homology to a known
            protein domain family. A powerful description of
            protein domains are profile Hidden Markov models
            (HMM) as stored in the Pfam database. In this paper
            we address the problem of identifying the splice
            form with the highest similarity to a protein domain
            family. Therefore, we take into consideration all
            possible splice forms. As demonstrated here for a
            number of genes, this homology based approach can be
            used successfully for predicting partial gene
            structures. Furthermore, we present some novel
            splice form predictions with high-scoring protein
            domain homology and point out that the detection of
            splice form specific protein domains helps to answer
            questions concerning hereditary diseases. Simple
            approaches based on a BLASTP search cannot be
            applied here, since the number of possible splice
            forms increases exponentially with the number of
            exons. To this end, we have developed an efficient
            polynomial-time algorithm, called ASFPred
            (Alternative Splice Form Prediction). This algorithm
            needs only a set of exons as input.}

abstract = {Noncoding RNAs that are-like mRNAs-spliced, capped, and 
            polyadenylated have important functions in cellular 
            processes. The inventory of these mRNA-like noncoding RNAs 
            (mlncRNAs), however, is incomplete even in well-studied 
            organisms, and so far, no computational methods exist to 
            predict such RNAs from genomic sequences only. The subclass 
            of these transcripts that is evolutionarily conserved 
            usually has conserved intron positions. We demonstrate here 
            that a genome-wide comparative genomics approach searching 
            for short conserved introns is capable of identifying 
            conserved transcripts with a high specificity. Our approach 
            requires neither an open reading frame nor substantial 
            sequence or secondary structure conservation in the 
            surrounding exons. Thus it identifies spliced transcripts in 
            an unbiased way. After applying our approach to insect 
            genomes, we predict 369 introns outside annotated coding 
            transcripts, of which 131 are confirmed by expressed 
            sequence tags (ESTs) and/or noncoding FlyBase transcripts. 
            Of the remaining 238 novel introns, about half are 
            associated with protein-coding genes-either extending coding 
            or untranslated regions or likely belonging to unannotated 
            coding genes. The remaining 129 introns belong to novel 
            mlncRNAs that are largely unstructured. Using RT-PCR, we 
            verified seven of 12 tested introns in novel mlncRNAs and 11 
            of 17 introns in novel coding genes. The expression level of 
            all verified mlncRNA transcripts is low but varies during 
            development, which suggests regulation. As conserved introns 
            indicate both purifying selection on the exon-intron 
            structure and conserved expression of the transcript in 
            related species, the novel mlncRNAs are good candidates for 
            functional transcripts.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing often occurs in the coding 
            sequence and alters protein structure and function. It is 
            mainly carried out in two ways: by skipping exons that 
            encode a certain protein feature and by introducing a 
            frameshift that changes the downstream protein sequence. 
            These mechanisms are widespread and well investigated. 
            RESULTS: Here, we propose an additional mechanism of 
            alternative splicing to modulate protein function. This 
            mechanism creates a protein feature by putting together two 
            non-consecutive exons or destroys a feature by inserting an 
            exon in its body. In contrast to other mechanisms, the 
            individual parts of the feature are present in both splice 
            variants but the feature is only functional in the splice 
            form where both parts are merged. We provide evidence for 
            this mechanism by performing a genome-wide search with four 
            protein features: transmembrane helices, phosphorylation and 
            glycosylation sites, and Pfam domains. CONCLUSION: We 
            describe a novel type of event that creates or removes a 
            protein feature by alternative splicing. Current data 
            suggest that these events are rare. Besides the four 
            features investigated here, this mechanism is conceivable 
            for many other protein features, especially for small linear 
            protein motifs. It is important for the characterization of 
            functional differences of two splice forms and should be 
            considered in genome-wide annotation efforts. Furthermore, 
            it offers a novel strategy for ab initio prediction of 
            alternative splice events.}

            non-EST based approaches are needed to extend our view of a 
            transcriptome. Here, we describe a novel method for the ab 
            initio prediction of alternative splice events that is 
            solely based on the annotation of Pfam domains. Furthermore, 
            we applied this approach in a genome-wide manner to all 
            human RefSeq transcripts and predicted a total of 321 exon 
            skipping and intron retention events. We show that this 
            method is very reliable as 78% (250 of 321) of our 
            predictions are confirmed by ESTs or cDNAs. Subsequent 
            analyses of splice events within Pfam domains revealed a 
            significant preference of alternative exon junctions to be 
            located at the protein surface and to avoid secondary 
            structure elements. Thus, splice events within Pfams are 
            probable to alter the structure and function of a domain 
            which makes them highly interesting for detailed biological 
            investigation. As Pfam domains are annotated in many other 
            species, our strategy to predict exon skipping and intron

            single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect such

                  alternatively from not alternatively spliced GYNGYN donors, 
                  we found differences in the binding to U1 snRNA, a strong 
                  correlation between U1 snRNA binding strength and the 
                  preferred donor, overrepresented sequence motifs in the 
                  adjacent introns, and a higher conservation of the exonic 
                  and intronic flanks between human and mouse. Extending our 
                  genome-wide analysis to seven other eukaryotic species, we 
                  found alternatively spliced GYNGYN donors in all species 
                  from mouse to C. elegans and even in A. thaliana. 
                  Experimental verification of a conserved GTAGTT donor of the 
                  STAT3 gene in human and mouse reveals a remarkably similar 
                  ratio of alternatively spliced transcripts in both species. 
                  CONCLUSION: In contrast to alternative splicing in general, 
                  GYNGYN donors in addition to NAGNAG acceptors enable subtle 
                  protein variations.}

            frequent in eukaryotes and substantially increase the 
            complexity of transcriptomes and proteomes. We have 
            developed a relational database, TassDB (TAndem Splice Site 
            DataBase), which stores extensive data about alternative 
            splice events at GYNGYN donors and NAGNAG acceptors. These 
            splice events are of subtle nature since they mostly result 
            in the insertion/deletion of a single amino acid or the 
            substitution of one amino acid by two others. Currently, 
            TassDB contains 114 554 tandem splice sites of eight 
            species, 5209 of which have EST/mRNA evidence for 
            alternative splicing. In addition, human SNPs that affect 
            NAGNAG acceptors are annotated. The database provides a 
            user-friendly interface to search for specific genes or for 
            genes containing tandem splice sites with specific features 
            as well as the possibility to download large datasets. This 
            database should facilitate further experimental studies and 
            large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites.

            It results in subtle changes in the transcripts and often in 
            the encoded proteins. Several of these tandem splice events 
            contribute to the repertoire of functionally different 
            proteins, whereas many are neutral or deleterious. 
            Remarkably, some of the functional events are differentially 
            spliced in tissues or developmental stages, whereas others 
            exhibit constant splicing ratios, indicating that function 
            is not always associated with differential splicing. 
            Stochastic splice site selection seems to play a major role 
            in these processes. Here, we review recent progress in 
            understanding functional and evolutionary aspects as well as 
            the mechanism of splicing at short-distance tandem sites.}

            structure context of the binding site also affects the

            single-stranded RNA regions and it was shown that the 
            sequestration of a binding motif in a double-strand

            knowledge about RNA secondary structures when searching for

            MEMERIS for searching sequence motifs in a set of RNA 
            sequences and simultaneously integrating information about 
            secondary structures. To abstract from specific structural

            artificial and biological data demonstrate that MEMERIS is 
            able to identify motifs in single-stranded regions even if a 
            stronger motif located in double-strand parts exists. The 
            discovered motif occurrences in biological datasets mostly 
            coincide with known protein-binding sites. This algorithm 
            can be used for finding the binding motif of single-stranded

            Cyanobacteria encode the two essential ribonucleases RNase E 
            and RNase J. Cyanobacterial RNase E is shorter than 
            homologues in other groups of bacteria and lacks both the

            C-terminal domain typical for RNase E of enterobacteria. In 
            order to investigate the function of RNase E in the model 
            cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we engineered a 
            temperature-sensitive RNase E mutant by introducing two

            inactivation of RNase E by a temperature shift (TIER-seq) 
            and to map 1472 RNase-E-dependent cleavage sites. We 
            inferred a dominating cleavage signature consisting of an 
            adenine at the -3 and a uridine at the +2 position within a 
            single-stranded segment of the RNA. The data identified 
            mRNAs likely regulated jointly by RNase E and an sRNA and

            the pivotal role of RNase E in post-transcriptional

            associations between genetic variants and a trait or disease 
            of interest free of prior biological hypotheses. GWAS 
            require stringent correction for multiple testing, with 
            genome-wide significance typically defined as association 
            p-value <5*10-8. This study presents a new tool that uses 
            external information about genes to prioritize SNP 
            associations (GenToS). For a given list of candidate genes, 
            GenToS calculates an appropriate statistical significance 
            threshold and then searches for trait-associated variants in 
            summary statistics from human GWAS. It thereby allows for 
            identifying trait-associated genetic variants that do not 
            meet genome-wide significance. The program additionally 
            tests for enrichment of significant candidate gene 
            associations in the human GWAS data compared to the number 
            expected by chance. As proof of principle, this report used 
            external information from a comprehensive resource of 
            genetically manipulated and systematically phenotyped mice. 
            Based on selected murine phenotypes for which human GWAS 
            data for corresponding traits were publicly available, 
            several candidate gene input lists were derived. Using 
            GenToS for the investigation of candidate genes underlying 
            murine skeletal phenotypes in data from a large human 
            discovery GWAS meta-analysis of bone mineral density 
            resulted in the identification of significantly associated 
            variants in 29 genes. Index variants in 28 of these loci 
            were subsequently replicated in an independent GWAS 
            replication step, highlighting that they are true positive 
            associations. One signal, COL11A1, has not been discovered 
            through GWAS so far and represents a novel human candidate 
            gene for altered bone mineral density. The number of 
            observed genes that contained significant SNP associations 
            in human GWAS based on murine candidate gene input lists was 
            much greater than the number expected by chance across 
            several complex human traits (enrichment p-value as low as 
            10-10). GenToS can be used with any candidate gene list, any 
            GWAS summary file, runs on a desktop computer and is freely

            genome editing and manipulation of gene expression. The 
            types and numbers of CRISPR-Cas systems vary substantially 
            between different organisms. Some filamentous cyanobacteria 
            harbor > 40 different putative CRISPR repeat-spacer 
            cassettes, while the number of cas gene instances is much 
            lower. Here we addressed the types and diversity of 
            CRISPR-Cas systems and of CRISPR-like repeat-spacer arrays 
            in 171 publicly available genomes of multicellular 
            cyanobacteria. The number of 1328 repeat-spacer arrays 
            exceeded the total of 391 encoded Cas1 proteins suggesting a 
            tendency for fragmentation or the involvement of alternative 
            adaptation factors. The model cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. 
            PCC 7120 contains only three cas1 genes but hosts three 
            Class 1, possibly one Class 2 and five orphan repeat-spacer 
            arrays, all of which exhibit crRNA-typical expression 
            patterns suggesting active transcription, maturation and 
            incorporation into CRISPR complexes. The CRISPR-Cas system 
            within the element interrupting the Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 
            fdxN gene, as well as analogous arrangements in other 
            strains, occupy the genetic elements that become excised 
            during the differentiation-related programmed site-specific 
            recombination. This fact indicates the propensity of these 
            elements for the integration of CRISPR-cas systems and 
            points to a previously not recognized connection. The gene 
            all3613 resembling a possible Class 2 effector protein is 
            linked to a short repeat-spacer array and a single tRNA

            inference by pure parsimony (HIPP). This genome
            analysis task, first formulated as a boolean
            satisfiability probelm by Lynce and Marques-Silva
            [1], has been performed successfully by modern
            SAT-Solvers. But, it is not as widely used as some
            better-publicized statistical tools, such as PHASE
            [2]. This paper presents the authors' assessment of
            the current situation, and a preliminary statement
            of intention concerning their aims in this
            area. Namely, the situation suggests three
            categories of improvements for making HIPP more
            widely-used within the biological community: 1) the
            ability to handle larger problems; 2) more detailed
            empirical understanding of the accuracy of the "pure
            parsimony" criterion; and 3) additional criteria and
            methods for improving on this level of accuracy.}

abstract = {RNA has many pivotal functions especially in the regulation 
            of gene expression by ncRNAs. Identification of their 
            structure is an important requirement for understanding 
            their function. Structure prediction alone is often 
            insufficient for this task, due to algorithmic problems, 
            parameter inaccuracies, and biological peculiarities. Among 
            the latter, there are base modifications, cotranscriptional 
            folding leading to folding traps, and conformational 
            switching as in the case of riboswitches. All these require 
            more in-depth analysis of the folding space. The major 
            drawback, which all methods have to cope with, is the 
            exponential growth of the folding space. Therefore, methods 
            are often limited in the sequence length they can analyze, 
            or they make use of heuristics, sampling, or abstraction. 
            Our approach adopts the abstraction strategy and remedies 
            some problems of existing methods. We introduce a 
            position-specific abstraction based on helices that we term 
            helix index shapes, or hishapes for short. Utilizing a 
            dynamic programming framework, we have implemented this 
            abstraction in the program RNAHeliCes. Furthermore, we 
            developed two hishape-based methods, one for energy barrier 
            estimation, called HiPath, and one for abstract structure 
            comparison, termed HiTed. We demonstrate the superior 
            performance of HiPath compared to other existing methods and 
            the competitive accuracy of HiTed. RNAHeliCes, together with 
            HiPath and HiTed, are available for download at

abstract = {Background/Aims: Prostate cancer represents the cancer with 
            the highest worldwide prevalence in men. Chromosome 8p23 has 
            shown suggestive genetic linkage to early-onset familial 
            prostate cancer and is frequently deleted in cancer cells of 
            the urogenital tract. Within this locus some beta-defensin 
            genes (among them DEFB4, DEFB103, DEFB104) are localized, 
            which are arranged in a gene cluster shown to exhibit an 
            extensive copy number variation in the population. This 
            structural variation considerably hampers genetic studies. 
            In a new approach considering both sequence as well as copy 
            number variations we aimed to compare the defensin locus at 
            8p23 in prostate cancer patients and controls. Methods: We 
            apply PCR/cloning-based haplotyping and high-throughput copy 
            number determination methods which allow assessment of both 
            individual haplotypes and gene copy numbers not accessible 
            to conventional SNP-based genotyping. Results: We 
            demonstrate association of four common DEFB104 haplotypes 
            with the risk of prostate cancer in two independent patient 
            cohorts. Moreover, we show that high copy numbers (>9) of 
            the defensin gene cluster are significantly underrepresented 
            in both patient samples. Conclusions: Our findings imply a 
            role of the antibacterial defensins in prostate 
            cancerogenesis qualifying distinct gene variants and copy 
            numbers as potential tumor markers.}

            the contribution of RNA-protein interactions in epigenetic 
            regulation. In male flies, roX long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) 
            harbor several redundant domains to interact with the 
            ubiquitin ligase male-specific lethal 2 (MSL2) and the RNA 
            helicase Maleless (MLE) for X-chromosomal regulation. 
            However, how these interactions provide the mechanics of 
            spreading remains unknown. By using the uvCLAP (UV 
            cross-linking and affinity purification) methodology, which 
            provides unprecedented information about RNA secondary 
            structures in vivo, we identified the minimal functional 
            unit of roX2 RNA. By using wild-type and various MLE mutant 
            derivatives, including a catalytically inactive MLE 
            derivative, MLE(GET), we show that the minimal roX RNA 
            contains two mutually exclusive stem-loops that exist in a 
            peculiar structural arrangement: When one stem-loop is 
            unwound by MLE, an alternate structure can form, likely 
            trapping MLE in this perpetually structured region. We show 
            that this functional unit is necessary for dosage 
            compensation, as mutations that disrupt this formation lead 
            to male lethality. Thus, we propose that roX2 lncRNA 
            contains an MLE-dependent affinity switch to enable 
            reversible interactions of the MSL complex to allow dosage 
            compensation of the X chromosome.}

            bind evolutionarily conserved domains containing tandem

            processing accumulates as three stabile 5' fragments in late 
            exponential growth. Mobility shift assays using various 
            mutants verified that the non-structured single-stranded 
            linker region of sRNA(162) (SLR) base-pairs with the 
            MM2440-MM2441 mRNA internally, thereby masking the predicted 
            ribosome binding site of MM2441. This most likely leads to 
            translational repression of the second cistron resulting in 
            dis-coordinated operon expression. Analysis of mutant RNAs

            the 5' end of sRNA(162) targets the 5'-untranslated region 
            of the cis-encoded MM2442 mRNA. Overall, this first study of 
            archaeal sRNA/mRNA-target interactions unraveled that 
            sRNA(162) acts as an antisense (as)RNA on cis- and 
            trans-encoded mRNAs via two distinct domains, indicating

abstract = {Introduction:
            Cholesterol and other lipids play an important role in the genesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Lipids are transported in bloodstream by lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are heterogeneous and consist of a dominant lipid part and a small protein part. The most common and referenced method to classify lipoproteins is by density. High density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) are of great interest in lipid research. However, lipoprotein analysis is elaborate and expensive. A model predicting the risk of cardiovascular disease depending on the lipid metabolism may be of great benefit. 
            Methods:
            Here, we present a refined version of a previously described model of the human lipoprotein metabolism. The model describes the behaviour of particular lipoproteins dependent on a set of reaction rates. Due to the large number of possible lipoprotein compositions, the computation is done by the stochastic Gillespie algorithm. The now presented model is based on a dataset of lipoprotein measurements (circa 2000 patients) and contains several changes and refinements to the prior approach.
            Results:
            Our model is able to reproduce measured lipid data of humans with normal lipoprotein values. Furthermore, certain lipoprotein-associated diseases like hypercholesterolemia may be simulated by modifying the associated parameters of the metabolism. As particular lipoproteins are simulated, we are able to get information about the distribution and metabolic rates of lipoproteins in all density classes.
            Discussion:
            The model is capable to investigate associated diseases of lipid metabolism and to provide a powerful tool for possible therapeutic approaches. However, there is still need for further improvements.}

            Background: Many functional RNA molecules fold into pseudoknot structures, which are
            often essential for the formation of an RNA's 3D structure.
            Currently the design of RNA molecules, which fold into a specific structure (known as RNA
            inverse folding) within biotechnological applications, is lacking the feature of
            incorporating pseudoknot structures into the design.
            Hairpin-(H)- and kissing hairpin-(K)-type pseudoknots cover a
            wide range of biologically functional pseudoknots and can be represented on a
            secondary structure level.
            Results: The RNA inverse folding program antaRNA, which takes secondary structure,
            target GC-content and sequence constraints as input, is extended to
            provide solutions for such H- and K-type pseudoknotted secondary structure
            constraint.
            We demonstrate the easy and flexible interchangeability of modules within the
            antaRNA framework by incorporating pKiss as structure prediction tool capable of
            predicting the mentioned pseudoknot types. The performance of the approach is
            demonstrated on a subset of the Pseudobase++ dataset.

            of the Freiburg RNA Tools webservice. Furthermore, antaRNA is available

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions are the most essential cellular process in eukaryotes 
            that involve many important biological activities such as signal transduction, 
            maintaining cell polarity etc. Many protein-protein interactions in cellular 
            signaling are mediated by modular protein domains. Peptide recognition modules 
            (PRMs) are an important subcluss of modular protein domains that specifically 
            recognize short linear peptides to mediate various post translational modifications. 
            Computational identification of modular domain-peptide interactions is an open challenge 
            with high relevance. In this study, we applied machine learning approaches to identify the 
            binding specificity of three modular protein domains (i.e. SH2, SH3, and PDZ domains). All 
            models are based on support vector machines with different kernel functions ranging from 
            polynomial, to Gaussian, to advanced graph kernels. In this way, we model non-linear 
            interactions between amino acid residues. Additionally, a powerful semi-supervised technique 
            was used to tackle the data-imbalance problem. We validated our results on manually curated 
            data sets and achieved competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, 
            we developed an interactive and easy-to-use webserver, namely MoDPepInt (Modular Domain-Peptide 
            Interactions), for the prediction of the binding partners for aforementioned modular protein 
            domains. Currently, we offer models for SH2, SH3 and PDZ domains, via the tools SH2PepInt, 
            SH3PepInt and PDZPepInt. More specifically, our server offers predictions for 51 SH2 human 
            domains and 69 SH3 human domains via single domain models, and predictions for 226 PDZ domains 
            across several species, via 43 multi-domain models. MoDPepInt includes the largest number of 
            models and offers a comprehensive domain-peptide prediction system in a single platform}

These pipelines, also known as workflows, can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools that can facilitate further data analysis. 
            Findings: A model is developed to recommend tools using a deep learning approach by analysing workflows composed by researchers on the European Galaxy server. The higher-order dependencies in workflows, represented as directed acyclic graphs, are learned by training a gated recurrent units neural network, a variant of a recurrent neural network. In the neural network training, the weights of tools used are derived from their usage frequencies over time and the sequences of tools are uniformly sampled from training data. Hyperparameters of the neural network are optimized using Bayesian optimization. Mean accuracy of 98 percent in recommending tools is achieved for the top-1 metric.
            Conclusions: The model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface integrations on the European Galaxy server. High-quality and highly used tools are shown at the top of the recommendations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) programs that 
            train on large datasets require powerful compute 
            infrastructure consisting of several CPU cores and GPUs. 
            JupyterLab provides an excellent framework for developing AI 
            programs, but it needs to be hosted on such an 
            infrastructure to enable faster training of AI programs 
            using parallel computing. FINDINGS: An open-source, 
            docker-based, and GPU-enabled JupyterLab infrastructure is 
            developed that runs on the public compute infrastructure of 
            Galaxy Europe consisting of thousands of CPU cores, many 
            GPUs, and several petabytes of storage to rapidly prototype 
            and develop end-to-end AI projects. Using a JupyterLab 
            notebook, long-running AI model training programs can also 
            be executed remotely to create trained models, represented 
            in open neural network exchange (ONNX) format, and other 
            output datasets in Galaxy. Other features include Git 
            integration for version control, the option of creating and 
            executing pipelines of notebooks, and multiple dashboards 
            and packages for monitoring compute resources and 
            visualization, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These features 
            make JupyterLab in Galaxy Europe highly suitable for 
            creating and managing AI projects. A recent scientific 
            publication that predicts infected regions in COVID-19 
            computed tomography scan images is reproduced using various 
            features of JupyterLab on Galaxy Europe. In addition, 
            ColabFold, a faster implementation of AlphaFold2, is 
            accessed in JupyterLab to predict the 3-dimensional 
            structure of protein sequences. JupyterLab is accessible in 
            2 ways-one as an interactive Galaxy tool and the other by 
            running the underlying Docker container. In both ways,

abstract = {BACKGROUND: PDZ domains are one of the most promiscuous 
            protein recognition modules that bind with short linear 
            peptides and play an important role in cellular signaling. 
            Recently, few high-throughput techniques (e.g. protein 
            microarray screen, phage display) have been applied to 
            determine in-vitro binding specificity of PDZ domains. 
            Currently, many computational methods are available to 
            predict PDZ-peptide interactions but they often provide 
            domain specific models and/or have a limited domain 
            coverage. RESULTS: Here, we composed the largest set of PDZ 
            domains derived from human, mouse, fly and worm proteomes 
            and defined binding models for PDZ domain families to 
            improve the domain coverage and prediction specificity. For 
            that purpose, we first identified a novel set of 138 PDZ 
            families, comprising of 548 PDZ domains from aforementioned 
            organisms, based on efficient clustering according to their 
            sequence identity. For 43 PDZ families, covering 226 PDZ 
            domains with available interaction data, we built 
            specialized models using a support vector machine approach. 
            The advantage of family-wise models is that they can also be 
            used to determine the binding specificity of a newly 
            characterized PDZ domain with sufficient sequence identity 
            to the known families. Since most current experimental 
            approaches provide only positive data, we have to cope with 
            the class imbalance problem. Thus, to enrich the negative 
            class, we introduced a powerful semi-supervised technique to 
            generate high confidence non-interaction data. We report 
            competitive predictive performance with respect to 
            state-of-the-art approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach has 
            several contributions. First, we show that domain coverage 
            can be increased by applying accurate clustering technique. 
            Second, we developed an approach based on a semi-supervised 
            strategy to get high confidence negative data. Third, we 
            allowed high order correlations between the amino acid 
            positions in the binding peptides. Fourth, our method is 
            general enough and will easily be applicable to other 
            peptide recognition modules such as SH2 domains and finally, 
            we performed a genome-wide prediction for 101 human and 102 
            mouse PDZ domains and uncovered novel interactions with 
            biological relevance. We make all the predictive models and 
            genome-wide predictions freely available to the scientific 
            community.}

            binding peptides to facilitate various molecular functions. 
            For determining the subtle binding specificities of SH2 
            domains, it is very important to understand the intriguing 
            mechanisms by which these domains recognize their target

            this kind of data are based on an initial multiple alignment 
            of the peptide ligands. Building an initial alignment can be 
            error-prone, especially in the case of the proline-rich 
            peptides bound by the SH3 domains. RESULTS: Here, we present 
            a machine-learning approach based on an efficient 
            graph-kernel technique to predict the specificity of a large 
            set of 70 human SH3 domains, which are an important class of 
            PRMs. The graph-kernel strategy allows us to (i) integrate 
            several types of physico-chemical information for each amino

            area under precision-recall curve for state-of-the-art

            better models can be obtained when we use information on the 
            noninteracting peptides (negative examples), which is 
            currently not used by the state-of-the art approaches based 
            on position weight matrices. To this end, we analyze two 
            strategies to identify subsets of high confidence negative 
            data. The techniques introduced here are more general and 
            hence can also be used for any other protein domains, which

            peptide-recognition modules (PRMs) that bind to 
            phosphotyrosine containing peptides. Knowledge about binding 
            partners of SH2-domains is key for a deeper understanding of 
            different cellular processes. Given the high binding 
            specificity of SH2, in-silico ligand peptide prediction is 
            of great interest. Currently however, only a few approaches 
            have been published for the prediction of SH2-peptide 
            interactions. Their main shortcomings range from limited 
            coverage, to restrictive modeling assumptions (they are 
            mainly based on position specific scoring matrices and do 
            not take into consideration complex amino acids 
            inter-dependencies) and high computational complexity. We 
            propose a simple yet effective machine learning approach for 
            a large set of known human SH2 domains. We used 
            comprehensive data from micro-array and peptide-array 
            experiments on 51 human SH2 domains. In order to deal with 
            the high data imbalance problem and the high signal-to-noise 
            ration, we casted the problem in a semi-supervised setting. 
            We report competitive predictive performance w.r.t. 
            state-of-the-art. Specifically we obtain 0.83 AUC ROC and 
            0.93 AUC PR in comparison to 0.71 AUC ROC and 0.87 AUC PR

            models can be obtained when the information on the 
            non-interacting peptides (negative examples) is also used. 
            Second, we improve performance when considering high order 
            correlations between the ligand positions employing 
            regularization techniques to effectively avoid overfitting 
            issues. Third, we developed an approach to tackle the data 
            imbalance problem using a semi-supervised strategy. Finally, 
            we performed a genome-wide prediction of human SH2-peptide 
            binding, uncovering several findings of biological 
            relevance. We make our models and genome-wide predictions, 
            for all the 51 SH2-domains, freely available to the

            understanding vital post-transcriptional processes. As 
            experimental data on mRNA structure are scarce, accurate 
            structure prediction is required to characterize RNA 
            regulatory mechanisms. Although various structure prediction 
            approaches are available, it is often unclear which to 
            choose and how to set their parameters. Furthermore, no 
            standard measure to compare predictions of local structure 
            exists. We assessed the performance of different methods 
            using two types of data: transcriptome-wide enzymatic 
            probing information and a large, curated set of 
            cis-regulatory elements. To compare the approaches, we 
            introduced structure accuracy, a measure that is applicable 
            to both global and local methods. Our results showed that 
            local folding was more accurate than the classic global 
            approach. We investigated how the locality parameters, 
            maximum base pair span and window size, influenced the 
            prediction performance. A span of 150 provided a reasonable 
            balance between maximizing the number of accurately 
            predicted base pairs, while minimizing effects of incorrect 
            long-range predictions. We characterized the error at 
            artificial sequence ends, which we reduced by setting the 
            window size sufficiently greater than the maximum span. Our

abstract = {Prokaryotes are known to acquire immunity against phages and viruses through a widely conserved RNA-based gene silencing pathway. Fragments of the foreign DNA are initially integrated into clusters of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs). During a new invasion these fragments are extracted from the CRISPR array as mature CRISPR-RNAs (crRNAs), which target the viral DNA for degradation. A small hairpin structure has been proposed to guide an endoribonuclease to the cleavage site and there is recent evidence of direct interaction between the stem-loop and the Cas6, one of the many CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. Based on sequence similarity, Kunin et al. (2007) reported 12 major families of CRISPR repeats and claimed that only six exhibit the typical hairpin motif. We have revisited structural properties of the CRISPR system on a genome-wide scale. Our results show that the hairpin motif is present in almost all families. Additionally, some sequences are misplaced and a few clusters ought to be subdivided into further families. Since repeats are able to form multiple stem-loop structures, we have developed an approach to predict the functional hairpin of a single CRISPR array by folding the repeat structures within the context of all spacer sequences. We show that the most probable hairpin in such a context is not always the minimum free energy (MFE) structure.}

            protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, using the 
            FSH receptor (FSH-R) as a model receptor, we demonstrate 
            that part of the translational regulations occurs by 
            phosphorylation of the translation pre-initiation complex 
            scaffold protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), 
            in HEK293 cells stably expressing the FSH-R. This 
            phosphorylation event occurred when eIF4G was bound to the 
            mRNA 5' cap, and probably involves mammalian target of 
            rapamycin. This regulation might contribute to cap-dependent 
            translation in response to FSH. The cap-binding protein 
            eIF4E also had its phosphorylation level enhanced upon FSH 
            stimulation. We also show that FSH-induced signaling not 
            only led to cap-dependent translation but also to internal 
            ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation of some 
            mRNA. These data add detailed information on the molecular

            spacers, as immunological recordings used to combat future 
            infections. Of the many spacers stored in a CRISPR array, 
            the most recent are known to be prioritized for immune 
            defence. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. 
            Here we show that the leader region upstream of CRISPR 
            arrays in CRISPR-Cas9 systems enhances CRISPR RNA (crRNA) 
            processing from the newest spacer, prioritizing defence 
            against the matching invader. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system 
            from Streptococcus pyogenes as a model, we found that the 
            transcribed leader interacts with the conserved repeats 
            bordering the newest spacer. The resulting interaction 
            promotes transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) hybridization with 
            the second of the two repeats, accelerating crRNA 
            processing. Accordingly, disruption of this structure 
            reduces the abundance of the associated crRNA and immune 
            defence against targeted plasmids and bacteriophages. Beyond 
            the S. pyogenes system, bioinformatics analyses revealed 
            that leader-repeat structures appear across CRISPR-Cas9 
            systems. CRISPR-Cas systems thus possess an RNA-based 
            mechanism to prioritize defence against the most recently

            environmental signals to control cell division are well 
            known in bacteria and eukaryotes, but their existence is 
            poorly understood in archaea. We identified a conserved gene 
            (cdrS) that encodes a small protein and is highly 
            transcribed in the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. The 
            cdrS gene could not be deleted, but CRISPR interference 
            (CRISPRi)-mediated repression of the cdrS gene caused slow 
            growth and cell division defects and changed the expression 
            of multiple genes and their products associated with cell 
            division, protein degradation, and metabolism. Consistent 
            with this complex regulatory network, overexpression of cdrS 
            inhibited cell division, whereas overexpression of the 
            operon encoding both CdrS and a tubulin-like cell division 
            protein (FtsZ2) stimulated division. Chromatin 
            immunoprecipitation-DNA sequencing (ChIP-Seq) identified 18 
            DNA-binding sites of the CdrS protein, including one 
            upstream of the promoter for a cell division gene, ftsZ1, 
            and another upstream of the essential gene dacZ, encoding 
            diadenylate cyclase involved in c-di-AMP signaling, which is 
            implicated in the regulation of cell division. These 
            findings suggest that CdrS is a transcription factor that 
            plays a central role in a regulatory network coordinating 
            metabolism and cell division. IMPORTANCE Cell division is a 
            central mechanism of life and is essential for growth and 
            development. Members of the Bacteria and Eukarya have 
            different mechanisms for cell division, which have been 
            studied in detail. In contrast, cell division in members of 
            the Archaea is still understudied, and its regulation is 
            poorly understood. Interestingly, different cell division 
            machineries appear in members of the Archaea, with the 
            Euryarchaeota using a cell division apparatus based on the 
            tubulin-like cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, as in bacteria. 
            Here, we identify the small protein CdrS as essential for 
            survival and a central regulator of cell division in the 
            euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. CdrS also appears to 
            coordinate other cellular pathways, including synthesis of 
            signaling molecules and protein degradation. Our results 
            show that CdrS plays a sophisticated role in cell division, 
            including regulation of numerous associated genes. These 
            findings are expected to initiate investigations into 
            conditional regulation of division in archaea.}

abstract = {The identification and characterization of rare immune cell 
            populations in humans can be facilitated by their growth 
            advantage in the context of specific genetic diseases. Here, 
            we use autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome to identify a 
            population of FAS-controlled TCRalphabeta+ T cells. They 
            include CD4+, CD8+, and double-negative T cells and can be 
            defined by a CD38+CD45RA+T-BET- expression pattern. These 
            unconventional T cells are present in healthy individuals, 
            are generated before birth, are enriched in lymphoid tissue, 
            and do not expand during acute viral infection. They are 
            characterized by a unique molecular signature that is 
            unambiguously different from other known T cell 
            differentiation subsets and independent of CD4 or CD8 
            expression. Functionally, FAS-controlled T cells represent 
            highly proliferative, noncytotoxic T cells with an IL-10 
            cytokine bias. Mechanistically, regulation of this 
            physiological population is mediated by FAS and CTLA4 
            signaling, and its survival is enhanced by mTOR and STAT3 
            signals. Genetic alterations in these pathways result in 
            expansion of FAS-controlled T cells, which can cause 
            significant lymphoproliferative disease.}

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR: Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and Cas: CRISPR associated) systems are unique defence mechanisms since they are able to adapt to new invaders and are heritable. CRISPR-Cas systems facilitate the sequence-specific elimination of invading genetic elements in prokaryotes, they are found in 45{\%} of bacteria and 85{\%} of archaea. Their general features have been studied in detail, but subtype- and species-specific variations await investigation. Haloarchaea is one of few archaeal classes in which CRISPR-Cas systems have been investigated in more than one genus. Here, we summarize the available information on CRISPR-Cas defence in three Haloarchaea: Haloferax volcanii, Haloferax mediterranei and Haloarcula hispanica. Haloarchaea share type I CRISPR-Cas systems, with subtype I-B being dominant. Type I-B systems rely on Cas proteins Cas5, Cas7, and Cas8b for the interference reaction and these proteins have been shown to form a Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence) -like complex in Hfx (Haloferax). volcanii. Cas6b is the endonuclease for crRNA (CRISPR RNA) maturation in type I-B systems but the protein is dispensable for interference in Hfx. volcanii. Haloarchaea share a common repeat sequence and crRNA-processing pattern. A prerequisite for successful invader recognition in Hfx. volcanii is base pairing over a ten-nucleotide-long non-contiguous seed sequence. Moreover, Hfx. volcanii and Har (Haloarcula). hispanica rely each on certain specific PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) sequences to elicit interference, but they share only one PAM sequence. Primed adaptation in Har. hispanica relies on another set of PAM sequences.}

abstract = {To fend off foreign genetic elements, prokaryotes have 
            developed several defense systems. The most recently 
            discovered defense system, CRISPR/Cas, is sequence-specific, 
            adaptive and heritable. The two central components of this 
            system are the Cas proteins and the CRISPR RNA. The latter 
            consists of repeat sequences that are interspersed with 
            spacer sequences. The CRISPR locus is transcribed into a 
            precursor RNA that is subsequently processed into short 
            crRNAs. CRISPR/Cas systems have been identified in bacteria 
            and archaea, and data show that many variations of this 
            system exist. We analyzed the requirements for a successful 
            defense reaction in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax 
            volcanii. Haloferax encodes a CRISPR/Cas system of the I-B 
            subtype, about which very little is known. Analysis of the 
            mature crRNAs revealed that they contain a spacer as their 
            central element, which is preceded by an 
            eight-nucleotide-long 5' handle that originates from the 
            upstream repeat. The repeat sequences have the potential to 
            fold into a minimal stem loop. Sequencing of the crRNA 
            population indicated that not all of the spacers that are 
            encoded by the three CRISPR loci are present in the same 
            abundance. By challenging Haloferax with an invader plasmid, 
            we demonstrated that the interaction of the crRNA with the 
            invader DNA requires a 10-nucleotide-long seed sequence. In 
            addition, we found that not all of the crRNAs from the three 
            CRISPR loci are effective at triggering the degradation of 
            invader plasmids. The interference does not seem to be 
            influenced by the copy number of the invader plasmid.}

            discovery of multiple, novel class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems, 
            which now include 3 types and 17 subtypes. A second major 
            novelty is the discovery of numerous derived CRISPR-Cas

            lack the nucleases required for interference. Some of these

However, several ciliary proteins, involved in gating access to the cilium, also assume localizations at other cellular sites including the nucleus, where they participate in DNA damage responses to maintain tissue integrity. Molecular insight into how these molecules execute such diverse functions remains limited. A mass spectrometry screen for ANKS6-interacting proteins suggested an involvement of ANKS6 in RNA processing and/or binding. Comparing the RNA-binding properties of the known RNA-binding protein BICC1 with the three ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKS3, ANKS6 (NPHP16) and INVERSIN (NPHP2) confirmed that certain nephronophthisis (NPH) family members can interact with RNA molecules. We also observed that BICC1 and INVERSIN associate with stress granules in response to translational inhibition. Furthermore, BICC1 recruits ANKS3 and ANKS6 into TIA-1-positive stress granules after exposure to hippuristanol. Our findings uncover a novel function of NPH family members, and provide further evidence that NPH family members together with BICC1 are involved in stress responses to maintain tissue and organ integrity.}}

            discretizing the structure space and simplifying the energy model over regular
            proteins, they enable detailed studies of protein structure
            formation and evolution.
            But even in the simplest lattice protein models, the prediction of optimal
            structures is computationally hard. Therefore, often
            heuristic approaches are applied to find such conformations.
            Commonly, heuristic methods find only locally optimal solutions.
            Nevertheless, there exist methods that guarantee to predict globally optimal
            structures. 
            Currently only one such exact approach is
            publicly available, namely the Constraint-based
            Protein Structure Prediction (CPSP) method and variants. Here, we review exact
            approaches and derived methods. We discuss fundamental concepts like
            hydrophobic core construction and their use in optimal structure prediction as
            well as possible applications like combinations of different energy
            models.}

These landmarks are used within a heuristic curve registration approach to align profile pairs by mapping similar characteristics onto each other. In combination with a progressive alignment scheme, this enables the computation of multiple curve alignments. Multiple curve alignments are needed to derive meaningful representative consensus data of measured time or data series. MICA was already successfully applied to generate representative profiles of tree growth data based on intra-annual wood density profiles or cell formation data. The MICA package provides a command-line and graphical user interface. The R interface enables the direct embedding of multiple curve alignment computation into larger analyses pipelines.

            approaches to the protein chain lattice fitting problem have been suggested but
            only a single backbone-only tool is available currently.
            We introduce LatFit, a new tool to produce high-accuracy lattice protein models.
            It generates both backbone-only and backbone-side-chain models in any user
            defined lattice. LatFit implements a new distance RMSD-optimisation fitting
            procedure in addition to the known coordinate RMSD method. The program is freely
            available for academic download and as a web-server:
            http://cpsp.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/LatFit/
            We tested LatFit's accuracy and speed using a large non-redundant set of high
            resolution proteins (SCOP database) on three commonly used lattices: 3D cubic,
            face-centred cubic, and knight's walk. Fitting speed compared favourably to
            other methods, and both backbone-only and backbone-side-chain models show low
            deviation from the original data about 1.5A RMSD in the FCC
            lattice). To our knowledge this represents the first comprehensive study of
            lattice quality for on-lattice protein models including side chains while
            LatFit is the only available tool for such models.}

            problems of very high inherent complexity. 
            Often these problems are tackled using simplified protein models,
            e.g. lattice proteins.
            The CPSP-tools package provides programs to solve exactly and completely
            the problems typical of studies using 3D lattice protein models. 
            Among the tasks addressed are the prediction of (all) globally optimal
            and/or suboptimal structures as well as sequence design and neutral 
            network exploration.
            
            Results: In contrast to stochastic approaches, which are
            not capable of answering many fundamental questions, our methods
            are based on fast, non-heuristic techniques.
            The  resulting tools are designed for high-throughput studies of
            3D-lattice proteins utilizing the Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model.

            extensive, high-throughput studies of non-restricted 3D-lattice

            The HP-model by Lau and Dill mimics globular water-soluble

            HPdesign uses the CPSP approach to solve the inverse folding problem for 
            three-dimensional lattices. Here, a sequence X is searched that

            We present LatFit, a new tool to produce high accuracy lattice protein models from protein atomic co-ordinates.

The explicit representation of side chains prevents unnatural collapse during structural studies and enables the reconstruction of full atom protein data.

Both backbone and side chain models produced by LatFit show low deviation from the original data. Results for backbone-only models are competitive or superior to results from literature. Computed on-lattice fits including side chains show similar low deviations.

  abstract= 	 {Background: Lattice models are a common abstraction used in the
study of protein structures and related topics.
Various approaches to the protein chain lattice fitting problem have
been suggested but only one tool is currently openly available and this is for
backbone-only models.
  
Results: We introduce LatFit, a new tool to produce high
accuracy lattice protein models from protein atomic co-ordinates. It generates
backbone-only models as well as lattice models including side chains in various
lattice types. LatFit implements a new dRMSD-optimisation fitting procedure
in addition to a known cRMSD-optimising method. 
The program is freely available for download or as a web server at
http://cpsp.informatik.uni-freiburg.de
Conclusions: We model a large non-redundant set of high resolution
proteins (SCOP database) on three commonly used lattices: 3D cubic (100), face
centred cubic (FCC, 110), and knight's walk (210). Both backbone and side chain
models produced by LatFit show low deviation from the original data (e.g.
1.5A RMSD in FCC lattice). To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive study of lattice quality for on-lattice protein models including
side chains.},

            structure is vital in determining its chemical properties
            and functionality. However, experimental
            methods to determine structure are very costly and
            time-consuming. Computational approaches, such
            as folding simulations and structure prediction algorithms,
            are quicker and cheaper but lack consistent
            accuracy. This currently restricts extensive computational
            studies to abstract protein models. It
            is thus essential that simplifications induced by the
            models do not negate scientific value. Key to this is
            the use of thoroughly defined protein-like sequences.
            In such cases abstract models can allow for the investigation
            of important biological questions.
            Here we present a procedure to generate and classify
            protein-like sequence data sets. Our LatPack
            tools, and the approach in general, are applicable
            to arbitrary lattice protein models. Identification
            is based on thermodynamic and kinetic features.
            Further LatPack can incorporate the sequential
            assembly of proteins by addressing co-translational
            folding.
            We demonstrate the approach in the widely used,
            unrestricted 3D-cubic HP-model. The resulting sequence
            set is the first large data set for this model
            exhibiting the protein-like properties required. Our
            data and tools are freely available and can be used
            to investigate protein-related problems. Furthermore
            our data sets can serve as the first benchmark
            sequence sets for folding algorithms that have traditionally
            only been tested on random sequences.}

The approach is evaluated on RNA secondary structure landscapes using a gradient basin definition for macro-states. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for exact transition models by comparing two barrier-based appoaches and perform a detailed investigation of gradient basins in RNA energy landscapes.

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The secondary structure of RNA 
            molecules is intimately related to their function and often 
            more conserved than the sequence. Hence, the important task 
            of searching databases for RNAs requires to match 
            sequence-structure patterns. Unfortunately, current tools 
            for this task have, in the best case, a running time that is 
            only linear in the size of sequence databases. Furthermore, 
            established index data structures for fast sequence 
            matching, like suffix trees or arrays, cannot benefit from 
            the complementarity constraints introduced by the secondary 
            structure of RNAs. RESULTS: We present a novel method and 
            readily applicable software for time efficient matching of 
            RNA sequence-structure patterns in sequence databases. Our 
            approach is based on affix arrays, a recently introduced 
            index data structure, preprocessed from the target database. 
            Affix arrays support bidirectional pattern search, which is 
            required for efficiently handling the structural constraints 
            of the pattern. Structural patterns like stem-loops can be 
            matched inside out, such that the loop region is matched 
            first and then the pairing bases on the boundaries are 
            matched consecutively. This allows to exploit base pairing 
            information for search space reduction and leads to an 
            expected running time that is sublinear in the size of the 
            sequence database. The incorporation of a new chaining 
            approach in the search of RNA sequence-structure patterns 
            enables the description of molecules folding into complex 
            secondary structures with multiple ordered patterns. The 
            chaining approach removes spurious matches from the set of 
            intermediate results, in particular of patterns with little 
            specificity. In benchmark experiments on the Rfam database, 
            our method runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than 
            previous methods. CONCLUSIONS: The presented method's 
            sublinear expected running time makes it well suited for RNA 
            sequence-structure pattern matching in large sequence 
            databases. RNA molecules containing several stem-loop 
            substructures can be described by multiple 
            sequence-structure patterns and their matches are 
            efficiently handled by a novel chaining method. Beyond our 
            algorithmic contributions, we provide with Structator a 
            complete and robust open-source software solution for 
            index-based search of RNA sequence-structure patterns. The

            Experimental structure probing data has been shown to improve thermodynamics-based RNA secondary structure prediction. To this end, chemical reactivity information (as provided e.g. by SHAPE) is incorporated, which encodes whether or not individual nucleotides are involved in intra-molecular structure. Since inter-molecular RNA-RNA interactions are often confined to unpaired RNA regions, SHAPE data is even more promising to improve interaction prediction. Here we show how such experimental data can be incorporated seamlessly into accessibility-based RNA-RNA interaction prediction approaches, as implemented in IntaRNA. This is possible via the computation and use of unpaired probabilities that incorporate the structure probing information. We show that experimental SHAPE data can significantly improve RNA-RNA interaction prediction. We evaluate our approach by investigating interactions of a spliceosomal U1 snRNA transcript with its target splice sites. When SHAPE data is incorporated, known target sites are predicted with increased precision and specificity.

abstract = {RNA molecules fold into complex structures as a result of intramolecular interactions between their nucleotides. The function of many non-coding RNAs and some cis-regulatory elements of messenger RNAs highly depends on their fold. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and other types of mutations can disrupt the native function of an RNA element by altering its base pairing pattern. Identifying the effect of a mutation on an RNA’s structure is, therefore, a crucial step in evaluating the impact of mutations on the post-transcriptional regulation and function of RNAs within the cell. Even though a single nucleotide variation can have striking impacts on the structure formation, interpreting and comparing the impact usually needs expertise and meticulous efforts. Here, we present MutaRNA, a web server for visualization and interpretation of mutation-induced changes on the RNA structure in an intuitive and integrative fashion. To this end, probabilities of base pairing and position-wise unpaired probabilities of wildtype and mutated RNA sequences are computed and compared. Differential heatmap-like dot plot representations in combination with circular plots and arc diagrams help to identify local structure abberations, which are otherwise hidden in standard outputs. Eventually, MutaRNA provides a comprehensive and comparative overview of the mutation-induced changes in base pairing potentials and accessibility.

Here we present GraphClust2, a comprehensive approach for scalable clustering of RNAs based on sequence and structural similarities. GraphClust2 bridges the gap between high-throughput sequencing and structural RNA analysis and provides an integrative solution by incorporating diverse experimental and genomic data in an accessible manner via the Galaxy framework. GraphClust2 can efficiently cluster and annotate large datasets of RNAs and supports structure-probing data. We demonstrate that the annotation performance of clustering functional RNAs can be considerably improved. Furthermore, an off-the-shelf procedure is introduced for identifying locally conserved structure candidates in long RNAs. We suggest the presence and the sparseness of phylogenetically conserved local structures for a collection of long non-coding RNAs.By clustering data from 2 cross-linking immunoprecipitation experiments, we demonstrate the benefits of GraphClust2 for motif discovery under the presence of biological and methodological biases. Finally, we uncover prominent targets of double-stranded RNA binding protein Roquin-1, such as BCOR’s 3′ untranslated region that contains multiple binding stem-loops that are evolutionary conserved.}}

Whereas structural RNA alignment strategies typically identify common structure for orthologous structured RNAs, clustering seeks to group paralogous RNAs based on structural similarities. However, existing approaches for clustering paralogous RNAs, do not take the compensatory base pair changes obtained from structure conservation in orthologous sequences into account.Here, we present RNAscClust, the implementation of a new algorithm to cluster a set of structured RNAs taking their respective structural conservation into account. For a set of multiple structural alignments of RNA sequences, each containing a paralog sequence included in a structural alignment of its orthologs, RNAscClust computes minimum free-energy structures for each sequence using conserved base pairs as prior information for the folding. The paralogs are then clustered using a graph kernel-based strategy, which identifies common structural features. We show that the clustering accuracy clearly benefits from an increasing degree of compensatory base pair changes in the alignments.RNAscClust is available at http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Software/RNAscClust.

The original algorithm, proposed by Sankoff, solves the theoretical problem exactly with a complexity of O(n6) in the full energy model. 
            Over the last two decades, several variants and improvements of the Sankoff algorithm have been proposed to reduce its extreme complexity by proposing simplified energy models or imposing restrictions on the predicted alignments.
            Results: Here we introduce a novel variant of Sankoff's algorithm that 
            reconciles the simplifications of PMcomp, namely moving from the full energy model to a simpler base pair-based model, with the accuracy of the loop-based full energy model. 
            Instead of estimating pseudo-energies from unconditional base pair probabilities, our model calculates energies from conditional base pair probabilities that allow to accurately capture structure probabilities, which obey a conditional dependency. Supporting modifications with surgical precision, this model gives rise to the fast and highly accurate novel algorithm Pankov (Probabilistic Sankoff-like simultaneous alignment and folding of RNAs inspired by Markov chains). Pankov benefits from the speed-up of excluding unreliable base-pairing without compromising the loop-based free energy model of the Sankoff's algorithm. We show that Pankov outperforms its predecessors LocARNA and SPARSE in folding quality and is faster than LocARNA. 
            Pankov is developed as a branch of the LocARNA package and available at https://github.com/mmiladi/Pankov.}

            structured RNA motifs in the genomes of Caenorhabditis 
            elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae using the RNAz program. 
            This approach explicitly evaluates comparative sequence 
            information to detect stabilizing selection acting on RNA 
            secondary structure. We detect 3,672 structured RNA motifs, 
            of which only 678 are known non-translated RNAs (ncRNAs) or 
            clear homologs of known C. elegans ncRNAs. Most of these 
            signals are located in introns or at a distance from known 
            protein-coding genes. With an estimated false positive rate 
            of about 50% and a sensitivity on the order of 50%, we 
            estimate that the nematode genomes contain between 3,000 and 
            4,000 RNAs with evolutionary conserved secondary structures. 
            Only a small fraction of these belongs to the known RNA 
            classes, including tRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, or microRNAs. A 
            relatively small class of ncRNA candidates is associated 
            with previously observed RNA-specific upstream elements.}

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas are adaptive immune systems that degrade foreign 
            genetic elements in archaea and bacteria. In carrying out 
            their immune functions, CRISPR-Cas systems heavily rely on 
            RNA components. These CRISPR (cr) RNAs are repeat-spacer 
            units that are produced by processing of pre-crRNA, the 
            transcript of CRISPR arrays, and guide Cas protein(s) to the 
            cognate invading nucleic acids, enabling their destruction. 
            Several bioinformatics tools have been developed to detect 
            CRISPR arrays based solely on DNA sequences, but all these 
            tools employ the same strategy of looking for repetitive 
            patterns, which might correspond to CRISPR array repeats. 
            The identified patterns are evaluated using a fixed, 
            built-in scoring function, and arrays exceeding a cut-off 
            value are reported. Here, we instead introduce a data-driven 
            approach that uses machine learning to detect and 
            differentiate true CRISPR arrays from false ones based on 
            several features. Our CRISPR detection tool, CRISPRidentify, 
            performs three steps: detection, feature extraction and 
            classification based on manually curated sets of positive 
            and negative examples of CRISPR arrays. The identified 
            CRISPR arrays are then reported to the user accompanied by 
            detailed annotation. We demonstrate that our approach 
            identifies not only previously detected CRISPR arrays, but 
            also CRISPR array candidates not detected by other tools. 
            Compared to other methods, our tool has a drastically 
            reduced false positive rate. In contrast to the existing 
            tools, our approach not only provides the user with the 
            basic statistics on the identified CRISPR arrays but also 
            produces a certainty score as a practical measure of the 
            likelihood that a given genomic region is a CRISPR array.}

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a Type II CRISPR 
            system that has rapidly become the most versatile and 
            widespread tool for genome engineering. It consists of two 
            components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide 
            RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) 
            with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for 
            both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are 
            well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins 
            and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the 
            bottleneck in detecting Class 2 CRISPR systems. RESULTS: We 
            introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracrRNA for screening and 
            evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline 
            combines evidence from different components of the 
            Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural 
            model via covariance models from a sequence-structure 
            alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As 
            additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal 
            (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNA-RNA 
            interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 5'-part 
            of the tracrRNA. Repeats are detected via an ML-based 
            approach (CRISPRidenify). Providing further evidence, we 
            detect the cassette containing the Cas9 (Type II CRISPR 
            systems) and Cas12 (Type V CRISPR systems) effector protein. 
            Our tool is the first for detecting tracrRNA for Type V 
            systems. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The implementation 
            of the CRISPRtracrRNA is available on GitHub upon requesting

            pseudoknots, computational prediction of pseudoknotted RNA 
            structure is still in its infancy due to high running time 
            and space consumption implied by the dynamic programming 
            formulations of the problem. RESULTS: We introduce 
            sparsification to significantly speedup the dynamic 
            programming approaches for pseudoknotted RNA structure 
            prediction, which also lower the space requirements. 
            Although sparsification has been applied to a number of 
            RNA-related structure prediction problems in the past few 
            years, we provide the first application of sparsification to 
            pseudoknotted RNA structure prediction specifically and to 
            handling gapped fragments more generally - which has a much 
            more complex recursive structure than other problems to 
            which sparsification has been applied. We analyse how to 
            sparsify four pseudoknot structure prediction algorithms, 
            among those the most general method available (the 
            Rivas-Eddy algorithm) and the fastest one (Reeder-Giegerich 
            algorithm). In all algorithms the number of "candidate" 
            substructures to be considered is reduced. CONCLUSION: 
            Experimental results on the sparsified Reeder-Giegerich 
            algorithm suggest a linear speedup over the unsparsified 
            implementation.}

            to fundamental computational and modeling issues. While existing simultaneous alignment and folding
            (SAF) algorithms successfully align homologous RNAs with precisely known boundaries (global SAF),
            the more pressing problem of identifying new classes of homologous RNAs in the genome (local SAF)
            is intrinsically more difficult and much less understood. Typically, the length of local alignments is strongly
            overestimated and alignment boundaries are dramatically mispredicted. We hypothesize that local SAF
            approaches are compromised this way due to a score bias, which is caused by the contribution of RNA
            structure similarity to their overall alignment score.
            Results: In the light of this hypothesis, we study pairwise local SAF for the first time systematically—
            based on a novel local RNA alignment benchmark set and quality measure. First, we vary the relative
            influence of structure similarity compared to sequence similarity. Putting more emphasis on the structure
            component leads to overestimating the length of local alignments. This clearly shows the bias of current
            scores and strongly hints at the structure component as its origin. Second, we study the interplay of several
            important scoring parameters by learning parameters for local and global SAF. The divergence of these
            optimized parameter sets underlines the fundamental obstacles for local SAF. Thirdly, by introducing a
            position-wise correction term in local SAF, we constructively solve its principal issues.}

            containing a C-terminally truncated Ig-alpha respond to 
            pervanadate stimulation with markedly reduced tyrosine 
            phosphorylation of SHIP1 and augmented activation of protein 
            kinase B. This indicates that SHIP1 is capable of 
            interacting with the C-terminus of Ig-alpha. Employing a 
            system of fluorescence resonance energy transfer in S2 
            cells, we can clearly demonstrate interaction between the 
            SH2-domain of SHIP1 and Ig-alpha. Furthermore, a 
            fluorescently labeled SH2-domain of SHIP1 translocates to 
            the plasma membrane in an Ig-alpha-dependent manner. 
            Interestingly, whereas the SHIP1 SH2-domain can be 
            pulled-down with phospho-peptides corresponding to the 
            immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) of 
            Ig-alpha from detergent lysates, no interaction between 
            full-length SHIP1 and the phosphorylated Ig-alpha ITAM can 
            be observed. Further studies show that the SH2-domain of 
            SHIP1 can bind to the C-terminus of the SHIP1 molecule, most 
            probably by inter- as well as intra-molecular means, and 
            that this interaction regulates the association between 
            different forms of SHIP1 and Ig-alpha.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) 
            represents a significant renal disease burden in childhood 
            and adolescence. In contrast to steroid sensitive nephrotic 
            syndrome (SSNS), renal outcomes are significantly poorer in 
            SRNS. Over the past decade, extensive genetic heterogeneity 
            has become evident while disease-causing variants are still 
            only identified in 30% of cases in previously reported 
            studies with proportion and type of variants identified 
            differing depending on the age of onset and ethnical 
            background of probands. A genetic diagnosis however can have 
            implications regarding clinical management, including kidney 
            transplantation, extrarenal disease manifestations, and, in 
            some cases, even causal therapy. Genetic diagnostics 
            therefore play an important role for the clinical care of 
            SRNS affected individuals. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Here, we 
            performed NPHS2 Sanger sequencing and subsequent exome 
            sequencing in 30 consanguineous Iranian families with a 
            child affected by SRNS with a mean age of onset of 16 
            months. We identified disease-causing variants and one 
            variant of uncertain significance in 22 families (73%), 
            including variants in NPHS1 (30%), followed by NPHS2 (20%), 
            WT1 (7%) as well as in NUP205, COQ6, ARHGDIA, SGPL1, and 
            NPHP1 in single cases. Eight of these variants have not 
            previously been reported as disease-causing, including four 
            NPHS1 variants and one variant in NPHS2, ARHGDIA, SGPL1, and 
            NPHP1 each. CONCLUSION: In line with previous studies in 
            non-Iranian subjects, we most frequently identified 
            disease-causing variants in NPHS1 and NPHS2. While Sanger 
            sequencing of NPHS2 can be considered as first diagnostic 
            step in non-congenital cases, the genetic heterogeneity 
            underlying SRNS renders next-generation sequencing based 
            diagnostics as the most efficient genetic screening method. 
            In accordance with the mainly autosomal recessive 
            inheritance pattern, diagnostic yield can be significantly 
            higher in consanguineous than in outbred populations.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While NGS allows rapid global detection of 
            transcripts, it remains difficult to distinguish ncRNAs from 
            short mRNAs. To detect potentially translated RNAs, we 
            developed an improved protocol for bacterial ribosomal 
            footprinting (RIBOseq). This allowed distinguishing ncRNA 
            from mRNA in EHEC. A high ratio of ribosomal footprints per 
            transcript (ribosomal coverage value, RCV) is expected to 
            indicate a translated RNA, while a low RCV should point to a 
            non-translated RNA. RESULTS: Based on their low RCV, 150 
            novel non-translated EHEC transcripts were identified as 
            putative ncRNAs, representing both antisense and intergenic 
            transcripts, 74 of which had expressed homologs in E. coli 
            MG1655. Bioinformatics analysis predicted statistically 
            significant target regulons for 15 of the intergenic 
            transcripts; experimental analysis revealed 4-fold or higher 
            differential expression of 46 novel ncRNA in different 
            growth media. Out of 329 annotated EHEC ncRNAs, 52 showed an 
            RCV similar to protein-coding genes, of those, 16 had 
            RIBOseq patterns matching annotated genes in other 
            enterobacteriaceae, and 11 seem to possess a Shine-Dalgarno 
            sequence, suggesting that such ncRNAs may encode small 
            proteins instead of being solely non-coding. To support that 
            the RIBOseq signals are reflecting translation, we tested 
            the ribosomal-footprint covered ORF of ryhB and found a 
            phenotype for the encoded peptide in iron-limiting 
            condition. CONCLUSION: Determination of the RCV is a useful 
            approach for a rapid first-step differentiation between 
            bacterial ncRNAs and small mRNAs. Further, many known ncRNAs 
            may encode proteins as well.}

            which is essential for neuronal development. The

            system against foreign nucleic acids. In the methanoarchaeon 
            Methanosarcina mazei Go1, two types of CRISPR-Cas systems 
            are present (type I-B and type III-C). Both loci encode a 
            Cas6 endonuclease, Cas6b-IB and Cas6b-IIIC, typically 
            responsible for maturation of functional short CRISPR RNAs 
            (crRNAs). To evaluate potential cross cleavage activity, we 
            biochemically characterized both Cas6b proteins regarding 
            their crRNA binding behavior and their ability to process 
            pre-crRNA from the respective CRISPR array in vivo. 
            Maturation of crRNA was studied in the respective single 
            deletion mutants by northern blot and RNA-Seq analysis 
            demonstrating that in vivo primarily Cas6b-IB is responsible 
            for crRNA processing of both CRISPR arrays. Tentative 
            protein level evidence for the translation of both Cas6b 
            proteins under standard growth conditions was detected, 
            arguing for different activities or a potential 
            non-redundant role of Cas6b-IIIC within the cell. 
            Conservation of both Cas6 endonucleases was observed in 
            several other M. mazei isolates, though a wide variety was 
            displayed. In general, repeat and leader sequence 
            conservation revealed a close correlation in the M. mazei 
            strains. The repeat sequences from both CRISPR arrays from 
            M. mazei Go1 contain the same sequence motif with 
            differences only in two nucleotides. These data stand in 
            contrast to all other analyzed M. mazei isolates, which have 
            at least one additional CRISPR array with repeats belonging 
            to another sequence motif. This conforms to the finding that 
            Cas6b-IB is the crucial and functional endonuclease in M.

            regulatory and catalytical function due to its
            distinguished structure. Consequentially, structure
            is conserved in evolution and state-of-the art RNA
            multiple alignment algorithms consider structure as
            well as sequence information. However, existing
            tools neglect the important aspect of
            locality. Notably, locality in RNA occurs as
            similarity of subsequences as well as similarity of
            only substructures. <p> We present a novel approach
            for multiple alignment of RNAs that deals with both
            kinds of locality. The approach extends LocARNA by
            structural locality and delegates the construction
            of multiple alignments to T-Coffee.  <p> The paper
            systematically investigates structural locality in
            known RNA families. Benchmarking multiple alignment
            tools on structurally local families shows the need
            for algorithmic support of this locality. The
            improvement in accuracy in special cases is achieved
            while staying competitive with state-of-the-art
            alignment tools across the whole Bralibase.  <p>

abstract = {BackgroundIdentifying sequence-structure motifs common to 
            two RNAs can speed up the comparison of structural RNAs 
            substantially. The core algorithm of the existent approach 
            ExpaRNA solves this problem for a priori known input 
            structures. However, such structures are rarely known; 
            moreover, predicting them computationally is no rescue, 
            since single sequence structure prediction is highly 
            unreliable.ResultsThe novel algorithm ExpaRNA-P computes 
            exactly matching sequence-structure motifs in entire 
            Boltzmann-distributed structure ensembles of two RNAs; 
            thereby we match and fold RNAs simultaneously, analogous to 
            the well-known inverted question marksimultaneous alignment 
            and folding inverted question mark of RNAs. While this 
            implies much higher flexibility compared to ExpaRNA, 
            ExpaRNA-P has the same very low complexity (quadratic in 
            time and space), which is enabled by its novel structure 
            ensemble-based sparsification. Furthermore, we devise a 
            generalized chaining algorithm to compute compatible subsets 
            of ExpaRNA-P inverted question marks sequence-structure 
            motifs. Resulting in the very fast RNA alignment approach 
            ExpLoc-P, we utilize the best chain as anchor constraints 
            for the sequence-structure alignment tool LocARNA. ExpLoc-P 
            is benchmarked in several variants and versus 
            state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we formally 
            introduce and evaluate strict and relaxed variants of the 
            problem; the latter makes the approach sensitive to 
            compensatory mutations. Across a benchmark set of typical 
            non-coding RNAs, ExpLoc-P has similar accuracy to LocARNA 
            but is four times faster (in both variants), while it 
            achieves a speed-up over 30-fold for the longest benchmark 
            sequences ( inverted question mark400nt). Finally, different 
            ExpLoc-P variants enable tailoring of the method to specific 
            application scenarios. ExpaRNA-P and ExpLoc-P are 
            distributed as part of the LocARNA package. The source code

            ExpaRNA-P inverted question marks novel ensemble-based 
            sparsification reduces its complexity to quadratic time and 
            space. Thereby, ExpaRNA-P significantly speeds up 
            sequence-structure alignment while maintaining the alignment

            and evolve rapidly when compared to other prokaryotic genes. 
            With the rapid increase in newly sequenced archaeal and 
            bacterial genomes, manual identification of CRISPR-Cas 
            systems is no longer viable. Thus, an automated approach is 
            required for advancing our understanding of the evolution 
            and diversity of these systems and for finding new 
            candidates for genome engineering in eukaryotic models. 
            RESULTS: We introduce CRISPRcasIdentifier, a new machine 
            learning-based tool that combines regression and 
            classification models for the prediction of potentially 
            missing proteins in instances of CRISPR-Cas systems and the 
            prediction of their respective subtypes. In contrast to 
            other available tools, CRISPRcasIdentifier can both detect 
            cas genes and extract potential association rules that 
            reveal functional modules for CRISPR-Cas systems. In our 
            experimental benchmark on the most recently published and 
            comprehensive CRISPR-Cas system dataset, CRISPRcasIdentifier 
            was compared with recent and state-of-the-art tools. 
            According to the experimental results, CRISPRcasIdentifier 
            presented the best Cas protein identification and subtype 
            classification performance. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our tool 
            greatly extends the classification of CRISPR cassettes and, 
            for the first time, predicts missing Cas proteins and 
            association rules between Cas proteins. Additionally, we 
            investigated the properties of CRISPR subtypes. The proposed 
            tool relies not only on the knowledge of manual CRISPR 
            annotation but also on models trained using machine 
            learning.}

            The sRNA154 deletion strain showed a significant decrease in 
            growth under N-limitation, pointing toward a regulatory role 
            of sRNA154 in N-metabolism. Aiming to elucidate its 
            regulatory function we characterized sRNA154 by means of 
            biochemical and genetic approaches. 24 homologs of sRNA154 
            were identified in recently reported draft genomes of 
            Methanosarcina strains, demonstrating high conservation in 
            sequence and predicted secondary structure with two highly 
            conserved single stranded loops. Transcriptome studies of 
            sRNA154 deletion mutants by an RNA-seq approach uncovered 
            nifH- and nrpA-mRNA, encoding the alpha-subunit of 
            nitrogenase and the transcriptional activator of the 
            nitrogen fixation (nif)-operon, as potential targets besides 
            other components of the N-metabolism. Furthermore, results 
            obtained from stability, complementation and western blot 
            analysis, as well as in silico target predictions combined 
            with electrophoretic mobility shift-assays, argue for a 
            stabilizing effect of sRNA154 on the polycistronic nif-mRNA 
            and nrpA-mRNA by binding with both loops. Further identified 
            N-related targets were studied, which demonstrates that 
            translation initiation of glnA2-mRNA, encoding glutamine 
            synthetase2, appears to be affected by sRNA154 masking the 
            ribosome binding site, whereas glnA1-mRNA appears to be 
            stabilized by sRNA154. Overall, we propose that sRNA154 has 
            a crucial regulatory role in N-metabolism in M. mazei by 
            stabilizing the polycistronic mRNA encoding nitrogenase and 
            glnA1-mRNA, as well as allowing a feed forward regulation of 
            nif-gene expression by stabilizing nrpA-mRNA. Consequently, 
            sRNA154 represents the first archaeal sRNA, for which a 
            positive posttranscriptional regulation is demonstrated as 
            well as inhibition of translation initiation.}

            different cell types including cardiac myocytes, endothelial

            analysis is needed to gain mechanistic insight into the

            type-specific analysis of nuclear mRNA and epigenetic 
            modifications is crucial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to purify 
            cardiac myocyte nuclei from hearts of different species by 
            magnetic- or fluorescent-assisted sorting and to determine 
            the nuclear and cellular RNA expression profiles and 
            epigenetic marks in a cardiac myocyte-specific manner. 
            METHODS AND RESULTS: Frozen cardiac tissue samples were used 
            to isolate cardiac myocyte nuclei. High sorting purity was 
            confirmed for cardiac myocyte nuclei isolated from mice, 
            rats and humans. Deep sequencing of nuclear RNA revealed a 
            major fraction of nascent, unspliced RNA in contrast to 
            results obtained from purified cardiac myocytes. Cardiac 
            myocyte nuclear and cellular RNA expression profiles showed 
            differences especially for metabolic genes. Genome-wide maps 
            of the transcriptional elongation mark H3K36me3 were 
            generated by chromatin-immunoprecipitation. Transcriptome 
            and epigenetic data confirmed the high degree of cardiac 
            myocyte-specificity of our protocol. An integrative analysis 
            of nuclear mRNA and histone mark occurrence indicated a 
            major impact of the chromatin state on transcriptional 
            activity in cardiac myocytes. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
            establishes cardiac myocyte-specific sorting of nuclei as a 
            universal method to investigate epigenetic and 
            transcriptional processes in cardiac myocytes of different 
            origins. These data sets provide novel insight into cardiac 
            myocyte transcription.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large RNA molecules are often composed of 
            multiple functional domains whose spatial arrangement 
            strongly influences their function. Pre-mRNA splicing, for 
            instance, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice 
            junctions that can be separated by very long introns. 
            Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus 
            genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial 
            distances in thermodynamic equilibrium harbors useful 
            information on the shape of the molecule that in turn can 
            give insights into the interplay of its functional domains. 
            RESULT: Spatial distance can be approximated by the 
            graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that 
            the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between a 
            fixed pair of nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time 
            by means of dynamic programming. While a naive 
            implementation would yield recursions with a very high time 
            complexity of O(n (6) D (5)) for sequence length n and D 
            distinct distance values, it is possible to reduce this to 
            O(n (4)) for practical applications in which predominantly 
            small distances are of of interest. Further reductions, 
            however, seem to be difficult. Therefore, we introduced 
            sampling approaches that are much easier to implement. They 
            are also theoretically favorable for several real-life 
            applications, in particular since these primarily concern 
            long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules. 
            CONCLUSIONS: The graph-distance distribution can be computed 
            using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude 
            approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that 
            the graph-distance can be related to the smFRET data. The

            In silico RNA-RNA interaction prediction is widely applied to identify putative interaction partners and to assess interaction details in base pair resolution.
            To verify specific interactions, in vitro evidence can be obtained via compensatory mutation experiments.
            Unfortunately, the selection of compensatory mutations is non-trivial and typically based on subjective ad hoc decisions.
            To support the decision process, we introduce our COmPensatOry MUtation Selector CopomuS.
            CopomuS evaluates the effects of mutations on RNA-RNA interaction formation using a set of 
            objective criteria, and outputs a reliable ranking of compensatory mutation candidates.
            For RNA-RNA interaction assessment, the state-of-the-art IntaRNA prediction tool is applied.
            We investigate characteristics of successfully verified RNA-RNA interactions from the literature, which guided the design of CopomuS.
            Finally, we evaluate its performance based on experimentally validated compensatory mutations of prokaryotic sRNAs and their target mRNAs.
            CopomuS predictions highly agree with known results, making it a valuable tool to support the design of verification experiments for RNA-RNA interactions.
            It is part of the IntaRNA package and available as stand-alone webserver for ad hoc application.}

            Seed  and  accessibility  constraints  are  core  features  to  enable  highly accurate sRNA target screens based on RNA-RNA interaction prediction.
            Currently, available tools provide different (sets of) constraints and default parameter sets.
            Thus, it is hard to impossible for users to estimate the influence of individual restrictions on the prediction results.
            Here, we present a systematic assessment of the impact of established and new constraints on sRNA target  prediction  both  on  a  qualitative  as  well as  computational  level.
            This is done exemplarily based on the performance of IntaRNA, one of the most exact sRNA target prediction tools.
            IntaRNA provides  various  ways  to  constrain considered seed interactions, e.g. based on  seed length, its accessibility, minimal unpaired probabilities, or energy thresholds, beside analogous constraints for the overall interaction.
            Thus, our results reveal the impact of individual constraints and their combinations.
            This  provides both a guide for users what is important and recommendations for existing and upcoming sRNA target prediction approaches.
            We show on a large sRNA target screen benchmark data set that only by altering the parameter set, IntaRNA recovers 30 percent more verified interactions while becoming 5-times faster.
            This exemplifies the potential of seed, accessibility and interaction constraints for sRNA target prediction.}

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The identification of protein and gene names 
            (PGNs) from the scientific literature requires semantic 
            resources: Terminological and lexical resources deliver the 
            term candidates into PGN tagging solutions and the gold 
            standard corpora (GSC) train them to identify term 
            parameters and contextual features. Ideally all three 
            resources, i.e. corpora, lexica and taggers, cover the same 
            domain knowledge, and thus support identification of the 
            same types of PGNs and cover all of them. Unfortunately, 
            none of the three serves as a predominant standard and for 
            this reason it is worth exploring, how these three resources 
            comply with each other. We systematically compare different 
            PGN taggers against publicly available corpora and analyze 
            the impact of the included lexical resource in their 
            performance. In particular, we determine the performance 
            gains through false positive filtering, which contributes to 
            the disambiguation of identified PGNs. RESULTS: In general, 
            machine learning approaches (ML-Tag) for PGN tagging show 
            higher F1-measure performance against the BioCreative-II and 
            Jnlpba GSCs (exact matching), whereas the lexicon based 
            approaches (LexTag) in combination with disambiguation 
            methods show better results on FsuPrge and PennBio. The 
            ML-Tag solutions balance precision and recall, whereas the 
            LexTag solutions have different precision and recall 
            profiles at the same F1-measure across all corpora. Higher 
            recall is achieved with larger lexical resources, which also 
            introduce more noise (false positive results). The ML-Tag 
            solutions certainly perform best, if the test corpus is from 
            the same GSC as the training corpus. As expected, the false 
            negative errors characterize the test corpora and - on the 
            other hand - the profiles of the false positive mistakes 
            characterize the tagging solutions. Lex-Tag solutions that 
            are based on a large terminological resource in combination 
            with false positive filtering produce better results, which, 
            in addition, provide concept identifiers from a knowledge 
            source in contrast to ML-Tag solutions. CONCLUSION: The 
            standard ML-Tag solutions achieve high performance, but not 
            across all corpora, and thus should be trained using several 
            different corpora to reduce possible biases. The LexTag 
            solutions have different profiles for their precision and 
            recall performance, but with similar F1-measure. This result 
            is surprising and suggests that they cover a portion of the 
            most common naming standards, but cope differently with the 
            term variability across the corpora. The false positive 
            filtering applied to LexTag solutions does improve the 
            results by increasing their precision without compromising 
            significantly their recall. The harmonisation of the 
            annotation schemes in combination with standardized lexical 
            resources in the tagging solutions will enable their 
            comparability and will pave the way for a shared standard.}

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Biomedical entities, their identifiers and 
            names, are essential in the representation of biomedical 
            facts and knowledge. In the same way, the complete set of 
            biomedical and chemical terms, i.e. the biomedical "term 
            space" (the "Lexeome"), forms a key resource to achieve the 
            full integration of the scientific literature with 
            biomedical data resources: any identified named entity can 
            immediately be normalized to the correct database entry. 
            This goal does not only require that we are aware of all 
            existing terms, but would also profit from knowing all their 
            senses and their semantic interpretation (ambiguities, 
            nestedness). RESULT: This study compiles a resource for 
            lexical terms of biomedical interest in a standard format 
            (called "LexEBI"), determines the overall number of terms, 
            their reuse in different resources and the nestedness of 
            terms. LexEBI comprises references for protein and gene 
            entries and their term variants and chemical entities 
            amongst other terms. In addition, disease terms have been 
            identified from Medline and PubmedCentral and added to 
            LexEBI. Our analysis demonstrates that the baseforms of 
            terms from the different semantic types show only little 
            polysemous use. Nonetheless, the term variants of protein 
            and gene names (PGNs) frequently contain species mentions, 
            which should have been avoided according to protein 
            annotation guidelines. Furthermore, the protein and gene 
            entities as well as the chemical entities, both do comprise 
            enzymes leading to hierarchical polysemy, and a large 
            portion of PGNs make reference to a chemical entity. 
            Altogether, according to our analysis based on the Medline 
            distribution, 401,869 unique PGNs in the documents contain a 
            reference to 25,022 chemical entities, 3,125 disease terms 
            or 1,576 species mentions. CONCLUSION: LexEBI delivers the 
            complete biomedical and chemical Lexeome in a standardized 
            representation (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz-srv/LexEBI/). 
            The resource provides the disease terms as open source 
            content, and fully interlinks terms across resources.}

            protein-coding genes, yet little is known about functional 
            interactions between miRNAs and their host genes. The 
            intronic miRNA miR-128 regulates neuronal excitability and 
            dendritic morphology of principal neurons during mouse 
            cerebral cortex development. Its conserved host genes, 
            R3hdm1 and Arpp21, are predicted RNA-binding proteins. Here 
            we use iCLIP to characterize ARPP21 recognition of 
            uridine-rich sequences with high specificity for 3'UTRs. 
            ARPP21 antagonizes miR-128 activity by co-regulating a 
            subset of miR-128 target mRNAs enriched for 
            neurodevelopmental functions. Protein-protein interaction 
            data and functional assays suggest that ARPP21 acts as a 
            positive post-transcriptional regulator by interacting with 
            the translation initiation complex eIF4F. This molecular 
            antagonism is reflected in inverse activities during 
            dendritogenesis: miR-128 overexpression or knockdown of 
            ARPP21 reduces dendritic complexity; ectopic ARPP21 leads to 
            an increase. Thus, we describe a unique example of 
            convergent function by two products of a single gene.}

            (CRISPR-associated) employs short crRNAs (CRISPR RNAs) to 
            target invading viral nucleic acids. A short spacer sequence 
            of these crRNAs can be derived from a viral genome and 
            recognizes a reoccurring attack of a virus via base 
            complementarity. We analyzed the effect of spacer sequences 
            on the maturation of crRNAs of the subtype I-B Methanococcus 
            maripaludis C5 CRISPR cluster. The responsible endonuclease, 
            termed Cas6b, bound non-hydrolyzable repeat RNA as a dimer 
            and mature crRNA as a monomer. Comparative analysis of Cas6b 
            processing of individual spacer-repeat-spacer RNA substrates 
            and crRNA stability revealed the potential influence of 
            spacer sequence and length on these parameters. Correlation 
            of these observations with the variable abundance of crRNAs 
            visualized by deep-sequencing analyses is discussed. 
            Finally, insertion of spacer and repeat sequences with 
            archaeal poly-T termination signals is suggested to be 
            prevented in archaeal CRISPR/Cas systems.}

            stem-loop domains. In S. meliloti, this trans-sRNA is 
            encoded downstream of the divK-pleD operon. ecpR1 belongs to 
            the stringent response regulon, and its expression was 
            induced by various stress factors and in stationary phase. 
            Induced EcpR1 overproduction led to cell elongation and 
            increased DNA content, while deletion of ecpR1 resulted in 
            reduced competitiveness. Computationally predicted EcpR1 
            targets were enriched with cell cycle-related mRNAs.

abstract = {Three different Eucalyptus urophylla clones grown under two different spacing regimes in an experimental site in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, were analyzed to test effects of clone identity, spacing, cambial age and hydroclimatic conditions on high-resolution intra-annual wood density profiles. Since distinct periodic tree-ring boundaries were not visible on the stem cross-sectional surfaces, finding an alternative method for synchronization of density profiles was crucial for the analysis. The challenge was to generate intra- and inter-tree synchronized density profiles that possess high amplitude variation and low phase variation. Thus, we developed a protocol and workflow of how such high-resolution density profiles can be spatially aligned and temporally annotated to enable correlation analyses between trees and with time series of environmental stimuli. Mean wood density was significantly different between clones, but not between the spacings. Wood density increased significantly with increasing cambial age and decreasing growth rate. Principal component analysis showed that the overall variability in the temporally annotated density profiles is dominated by a highly significant common signal. We found significant negative correlation values for precipitation, indicating that water supply is the main driver of stem growth at the site, and providing evidence for the correctness of the method. The developed workflow can easily be adjusted to the analysis of other intra-annual tree-ring features like anatomical xylem cell traits or isotopic signals in the wood. It has a large potential to be used as a general guideline for the synchronization of intra-annual tree-ring traits, especially when distinct tree-ring boundaries are missing, as it is often the case under tropical climatic conditions. The workflow supports the development of spatially aligned and temporally annotated chronologies under non-annual growth rhythms.}

Most lncRNAs are under lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary structures, making it hard to predict them computationally. Results: We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine learning. It is based on detecting signatures of characteristic splice site evolution in vertebrate whole genome alignments. First, we predict individual splice sites, then assemble compatible sites into exon candidates, and finally predict multi-exon transcripts. Using a novel method to evaluate typical splice site substitution patterns that explicitly takes the species phylogeny into account, we show that individual splice sites can be accurately predicted. Since our approach relies only on predicted splice sites, it can uncover both coding and non-coding exons. We show that our predicted exons and partial transcripts are mostly non-coding and lack conserved secondary structures. These exons are of particular interest, since existing computational approaches cannot detect them. Transcriptome sequencing data indicate tissue-specific expression patterns of predicted exons and there is evidence that increasing sequencing depth and breadth will validate additional predictions. We also found a significant enrichment of predicted exons that form multi-exon transcript parts, and we experimentally validate such a novel multi-exon gene. Overall, we obtain 336 novel multi-exon transcript predictions from human intergenic regions. Our results indicate the existence of novel human transcripts that are conserved in evolution and our approach contributes to the completion of the human transcript catalog.

            In this contribution, we explore in detail the evolutionary traces of the eosinophil granule ontogeny transcript (EGOT), an experimentally confirmed representative of an abundant class of totally intronic non-coding transcripts (TINs). EGOT is located  antisense to an intron of the ITPR1 gene. We computationally identify putative EGOT orthologs in the genomes of 32 different amniotes, including orthologs from primates, rodents, ungulates, carnivores, afrotherians, and xenarthrans, as well as putative candidates from basal amniotes, such as opossum or platypus. We investigate the EGOT gene phylogeny, analyse patterns of sequence conservation, and the evolutionary conservation of the EGOT gene structure. We show that EGO-B, the spliced isoform, may be present throughout the placental mammals, but most likely dates back even further. We demonstrat here for the first time that the whole EGOT locus is highly structured, containing several evolutionary conserved and thermodynamic stable secondary structures.
            Our analyses allow us to postulate novel functional roles of a hitherto poorly understood region at the intron of EGO-B which is highly conserved at the sequence level. The region contains a novel ITPR1 exon and also conserved RNA secondary structures together with a conserved TATA-like element, which putatively acts as a promoter of an independent regulatory element.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent experimental and computational studies 
            have provided overwhelming evidence for a plethora of 
            diverse transcripts that are unrelated to protein-coding 
            genes. One subclass consists of those RNAs that require 
            distinctive secondary structure motifs to exert their 
            biological function and hence exhibit distinctive patterns 
            of sequence conservation characteristic for positive 
            selection on RNA secondary structure.The deep-sequencing of 
            12 drosophilid species coordinated by the NHGRI provides an 
            ideal data set of comparative computational approaches to 
            determine those genomic loci that code for evolutionarily 
            conserved RNA motifs. This class of loci includes the 
            majority of the known small ncRNAs as well as structured RNA 
            motifs in mRNAs. We report here on a genome-wide survey 
            using RNAz. RESULTS: We obtain 16 000 high quality 
            predictions among which we recover the majority of the known 
            ncRNAs. Taking a pessimistically estimated false discovery 
            rate of 40% into account, this implies that at least some 
            ten thousand loci in the Drosophila genome show the 
            hallmarks of stabilizing selection action of RNA structure, 
            and hence are most likely functional at the RNA level. A 
            subset of RNAz predictions overlapping with TRF1 and BRF 
            binding sites [Isogai et al., EMBO J. 26: 79-89 (2007)], 
            which are plausible candidates of Pol III transcripts, have 
            been studied in more detail. Among these sequences we 
            identify several "clusters" of ncRNA candidates with 
            striking structural similarities. CONCLUSION: The 
            statistical evaluation of the RNAz predictions in comparison 
            with a similar analysis of vertebrate genomes [Washietl et 
            al., Nat. Biotech. 23: 1383-1390 (2005)] shows that 
            qualitatively similar fractions of structured RNAs are found 
            in introns, UTRs, and intergenic regions. The intergenic RNA 
            structures, however, are concentrated much more closely 
            around known protein-coding loci, suggesting that flies have 
            significantly smaller complement of independent structured 
            ncRNAs compared to mammals.}

            optimized for speed and hence is particulary well-suited to 
            pilot studies. We demonstrate the practical use of NcDNAlign 
            in three case studies: the search for ncRNAs in 
            gammaproteobacteria and the analysis of conserved noncoding 
            DNA in nematodes and teleost fish, in the latter case 
            focusing on the fate of duplicated ultra-conserved regions. 
            Compared to the currently widely used genome-wide alignment

            bacterial ncRNA prediction based on alignments of both

            rates, and up to 100 putatively novel ncRNA structures. 
            Similar findings hold for our application of NcDNAlign to 
            the identification of ultra-conserved regions in nematodes 
            and teleosts. Both approaches yield conserved sequences of 
            unknown function, result in novel evolutionary insights into 
            conservation patterns among these genomes, and manifest the

            splice sites, it can uncover both coding and non-coding 
            exons. We show that our predicted exons and partial 
            transcripts are mostly non-coding and lack conserved 
            secondary structures. These exons are of particular 
            interest, since existing computational approaches cannot 
            detect them. Transcriptome sequencing data indicate 
            tissue-specific expression patterns of predicted exons and 
            there is evidence that increasing sequencing depth and 
            breadth will validate additional predictions. We also found 
            a significant enrichment of predicted exons that form 
            multi-exon transcript parts, and we experimentally validate 
            such a novel multi-exon gene. Overall, we obtain 336 novel 
            multi-exon transcript predictions from human intergenic 
            regions. Our results indicate the existence of novel human 
            transcripts that are conserved in evolution and our approach 
            contributes to the completion of the human transcript 
            catalog. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Predicted human 
            splice sites, exons and gene structures together with a Perl

            We report here on a computational survey of structured 
            non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in teleost genomes, focusing on the 
            fate of fish-specific duplicates. As in other metazoan 
            groups, we find evidence of a large number (11,543) of 
            structured RNAs, most of which (~86%) are clade-specific or 
            evolve so fast that their tetrapod homologs cannot be 
            detected. In surprising contrast to protein-coding genes, 
            the fish-specific genome duplication did not lead to a large 
            number of paralogous ncRNAs: only 188 candidates, mostly 
            microRNAs, appear in a larger copy number in teleosts than 
            in tetrapods, suggesting that large-scale gene duplications 
            do not play a major role in the expansion of the vertebrate 
            ncRNA inventory.}

            fraction of the transcriptional output consists of long, 
            mRNA-like, non-protein-coding transcripts (mlncRNAs). The 
            evolutionary history of mlncRNAs is still largely uncharted 
            territory. In this contribution, we explore in detail the 
            evolutionary traces of the eosinophil granule ontogeny 
            transcript (EGOT), an experimentally confirmed 
            representative of an abundant class of totally intronic 
            non-coding transcripts (TINs). EGOT is located antisense to 
            an intron of the ITPR1 gene. We computationally identify 
            putative EGOT orthologs in the genomes of 32 different 
            amniotes, including orthologs from primates, rodents, 
            ungulates, carnivores, afrotherians, and xenarthrans, as 
            well as putative candidates from basal amniotes, such as 
            opossum or platypus. We investigate the EGOT gene phylogeny, 
            analyze patterns of sequence conservation, and the 
            evolutionary conservation of the EGOT gene structure. We 
            show that EGO-B, the spliced isoform, may be present 
            throughout the placental mammals, but most likely dates back 
            even further. We demonstrate here for the first time that 
            the whole EGOT locus is highly structured, containing 
            several evolutionary conserved, and thermodynamic stable 
            secondary structures. Our analyses allow us to postulate 
            novel functional roles of a hitherto poorly understood 
            region at the intron of EGO-B which is highly conserved at 
            the sequence level. The region contains a novel ITPR1 exon 
            and also conserved RNA secondary structures together with a 
            conserved TATA-like element, which putatively acts as a 
            promoter of an independent regulatory element.}

            of ncRNAs that regulate gene expression by prohibiting the 
            translation of an mRNA by establishing stable interactions 
            with a target sequence. There is great demand for efficient 
            computational methods to predict the specific interaction 
            between an ncRNA and its target mRNA(s). There are a number 
            of algorithms in the literature which can predict a variety 
            of such interactions - unfortunately at a very high 
            computational cost. Although some existing target prediction 
            approaches are much faster, they are specialized for 
            interactions with a single binding site. METHODS: In this 
            paper we present a novel algorithm to accurately predict the 
            minimum free energy structure of RNA-RNA interaction under 
            the most general type of interactions studied in the 
            literature. Moreover, we introduce a fast heuristic method 
            to predict the specific (multiple) binding sites of two 
            interacting RNAs. RESULTS: We verify the performance of our 
            algorithms for joint structure and binding site prediction 
            on a set of known interacting RNA pairs. Experimental 
            results show our algorithms are highly accurate and 
            outperform all competitive approaches.}

            been identified, but the number of experimentally verified
            targets is considerably low. Thus, computational target
            prediction methods are on high demand. Whereas all previous
            approaches for predicting a general joint structure have a
            complexity of $O(n^6)$ running time and $O(n^4)$ space, a more time
            and space efficient interaction prediction that is able to
            handle complex joint structures is necessary for genome-wide
            target prediction problems. In this paper we show how to reduce
            both the time and space complexity of the RNA-RNA interaction
            prediction problem as described by Alkan et al. via dynamic
            programming sparsification - which allows to discard large
            portions of DP tables without loosing optimality. Applying
            sparsification techniques reduces the complexity of the original
            algorithm from $O(n^6)$ time and $O(n^4)$ space to $O(n^4 \psi(n))$ time
            and $O(n^2 \psi(n) + n^3)$ space for some function $\psi(n)$, which turns
            out to have small values for the range of $n$ that we encounter in
            practice. Under the assumption that the polymer-zeta property
            holds for RNA-structures, we demonstrate that $\psi(n)=O(n)$ on
            average, resulting in a linear time and space complexity
            improvement over the original algorithm. We evaluate our
            sparsified algorithm for RNA-RNA interaction prediction by total
            free energy minimization, based on the energy model of Chitsaz
            et al., on a set of known interactions. Our results confirm
            the significant reduction of time and space requirements in
            practice.}

Within this study, over 1.5 million hydrophobic-polar sequences were classified based on their ability to attain a unique but not necessarily minimal energy conformation via co-translational folding. The sequence and structure properties of the sets were then compared to elucidate signatures of co-translational folding. The strongest signature of co-translational folding is a reduced number of possible favourable contacts in the amino-terminus. There is no evidence of fewer contacts, more local contacts, nor less compact structures. Co-translational folding does produce a more compact amino- than carboxy-terminal region and an amino-terminal biased set of core residues. In real proteins these signatures are also observed and found most strongly in proteins of the SCOP alpha/beta class where 71% have an amino-terminal set of core residues. The prominence of co-translational features in experimentally determined protein structures suggests that the importance of co-translational folding is currently underestimated.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several recent studies indicate that 
            alternative splicing in Arabidopsis and other plants is a 
            common mechanism for post-transcriptional modulation of gene 
            expression. However, few analyses have been done so far to 
            elucidate the functional relevance of alternative splicing 
            in higher plants. Representing a frequent and universal 
            subtle alternative splicing event among eukaryotes, 
            alternative splicing at NAGNAG acceptors contributes to 
            transcriptome diversity and therefore, proteome plasticity. 
            Alternatively spliced NAGNAG acceptors are overrepresented 
            in genes coding for proteins with RNA-recognition motifs 
            (RRMs). As SR proteins, a family of RRM-containing important 
            splicing factors, are known to be extensively alternatively 
            spliced in Arabidopsis, we analyzed alternative splicing at 
            NAGNAG acceptors in SR and SR-related genes. RESULTS: In a 
            comprehensive analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, 
            we identified 6,772 introns that exhibit a NAGNAG acceptor 
            motif. Alternative splicing at these acceptors was assessed 
            using available EST data, complemented by a sequence-based 
            prediction method. Of the 36 identified introns within 30 SR 
            and SR-related protein-coding genes that have a NAGNAG 
            acceptor, we selected 15 candidates for an experimental 
            analysis of alternative splicing under several conditions. 
            We provide experimental evidence for 8 of these candidates 
            being alternatively spliced. Quantifying the ratio of 
            NAGNAG-derived splice variants under several conditions, we 
            found organ-specific splicing ratios in adult plants and 
            changes in seedlings of different ages. Splicing ratio 
            changes were observed in response to heat shock and most 
            strikingly, cold shock. Interestingly, the patterns of 
            differential splicing ratios are similar for all analyzed 
            genes. CONCLUSION: NAGNAG acceptors frequently occur in the 
            Arabidopsis genome and are particularly prevalent in SR and 
            SR-related protein-coding genes. A lack of extensive EST 
            coverage can be compensated by using the proposed

            crRNAs had profoundly varying abundances despite single

            for determining the function of putative non-coding RNAs. 
            Existing methods for the prediction of interactions are all 
            based on single sequences. Since comparative methods have 
            already been useful in RNA structure determination, we 
            assume that conserved RNA-RNA interactions also imply 
            conserved function. Of these, we further assume that a 
            non-negligible amount of the existing RNA-RNA interactions 
            have also acquired compensating base changes throughout 
            evolution. We implement a method, PETcofold, that can take 
            covariance information in intra-molecular and 
            inter-molecular base pairs into account to predict 
            interactions and secondary structures of two multiple 
            alignments of RNA sequences. RESULTS: PETcofold's ability to 
            predict RNA-RNA interactions was evaluated on a carefully 
            curated dataset of 32 bacterial small RNAs and their 
            targets, which was manually extracted from the literature. 
            For evaluation of both RNA-RNA interaction and structure 
            prediction, we were able to extract only a few high-quality 
            examples: one vertebrate small nucleolar RNA and four 
            bacterial small RNAs. For these we show that the prediction 
            can be improved by our comparative approach. Furthermore, 
            PETcofold was evaluated on controlled data with 
            phylogenetically simulated sequences enriched for covariance 
            patterns at the interaction sites. We observed increased 
            performance with increased amounts of covariance.

            (ncRNAs) function through complementary binding with mRNAs 
            or other ncRNAs, e.g., microRNAs, snoRNAs and bacterial 
            sRNAs. Predicting these RNA interactions is essential for 
            functional studies of putative ncRNAs or for the design of 
            artificial RNAs. Many ncRNAs show clear signs of undergoing 
            compensating base changes over evolutionary time. Here, we 
            postulate that a non-negligible part of the existing RNA-RNA 
            interactions contain preserved but covarying patterns of 
            interactions. METHODS: We present a novel method that takes 
            compensating base changes across the binding sites into 
            account. The algorithm works in two steps on two 
            pre-generated multiple alignments. In the first step, 
            individual base pairs with high reliability are found using 
            the PETfold algorithm, which includes evolutionary and 
            thermodynamic properties. In step two (where high 
            reliability base pairs from step one are constrained as 
            unpaired), the principle of cofolding is combined with 
            hierarchical folding. The final prediction of intra- and 
            inter-molecular base pairs consists of the reliabilities 
            computed from the constrained expected accuracy scoring, 
            which is an extended version of that used for individual 
            multiple alignments. RESULTS: We derived a rather extensive 
            algorithm. One of the advantages of our approach (in 
            contrast to other RNA-RNA interaction prediction methods) is 
            the application of covariance detection and prediction of 
            pseudoknots between intra- and inter-molecular base pairs. 
            As a proof of concept, we show an example and discuss the 
            strengths and weaknesses of the approach.}

            intertwined with cofunctional accessory genes, including 
            genes encoding CRISPR-associated Rossman Fold (CARF)

            a Type III association score accounting for coevolution and 
            specificity of flanking genes, we identified and classified 
            39 new Type III associated gene families. Most archaeal and

            several accessory genes, around half of which did not encode

            blotting and interference assays in Synechocystis confirmed

abstract = {Synonymous mutations have been viewed as silent mutations, 
            since they only affect the DNA and mRNA, but not the amino 
            acid sequence of the resulting protein. Nonetheless, recent 
            studies suggest their significant impact on splicing, RNA 
            stability, RNA folding, translation or co-translational 
            protein folding. Hence, we compile 659194 synonymous 
            mutations found in human cancer and characterize their 
            properties. We provide the user-friendly, comprehensive 
            resource for synonymous mutations in cancer, SynMICdb ( 
            http://SynMICdb.dkfz.de ), which also contains orthogonal 
            information about gene annotation, recurrence, mutation 
            loads, cancer association, conservation, alternative events, 
            impact on mRNA structure and a SynMICdb score. Notably, 
            synonymous and missense mutations are depleted at the 5'-end 
            of the coding sequence as well as at the ends of internal 
            exons independent of mutational signatures. For 
            patient-derived synonymous mutations in the oncogene KRAS,

            describe a novel approach for multiple alignment of RNAs 
            (MARNA) taking into consideration both the primary and the 
            secondary structures. It is based on pairwise 
            sequence-structure comparisons of RNAs. From these 
            sequence-structure alignments, libraries of weighted 
            alignment edges are generated. The weights reflect the 
            sequential and structural conservation. For sequences whose 
            secondary structures are missing, the libraries are 
            generated by sampling low energy conformations. The 
            libraries are then processed by the T-Coffee system, which 
            is a consistency based multiple alignment method. 
            Furthermore, we are able to extract a consensus-sequence and

            infer common catalytic or regulatory functions based
            on primary sequences and secondary structures. Some
            programs have been developed that compare RNAs with
            such given structures. Nevertheless, the most
            important problem is that it is hard to determine
            the adopted structures of RNAs which are a necessary
            prerequisite to numerous applications; once a
            structure has been assigned to a sequence (e.g. the
            minimum free energy structure), it influences the
            output of the programs and thus affects the
            scientific result, especially when dealing with a
            set of multiple RNAs. In this paper, we go one step
            further and analyze distances between RNA structure
            ensembles. They reflect structural relationships
            computed basically on base-pairing probability
            matrices.  We propose a distance measure between two
            base-pairing probability matrices showing similar or
            non-similar structural folding behaviour. This
            includes the detection of shared optimal, suboptimal
            and local secondary structures. Consequently, our
            distance measure avoids falling into the trap of
            fixing specific structures. A pairwise comparison
            strategy in a set of multiple RNAs leads us to
            construct a network of structural relationships
            using the neighbour joining method.  Attempts to
            predict phylogenetic trees are discussed and
            demonstrated by means of viral RNAs.}

            locality is based on the connections of nucleotides given by

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is a major 
            contributor to the diversity of eukaryotic transcriptomes 
            and proteomes. Currently, large scale detection of 
            alternative splicing using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or 
            microarrays does not capture all alternative splicing 
            events. Moreover, for many species genomic data is being 
            produced at a far greater rate than corresponding transcript 
            data, hence in silico methods of predicting alternative 
            splicing have to be improved. RESULTS: Here, we show that 
            the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) allows accurate 
            prediction of evolutionary conserved exon skipping events. 
            At a stringent false positive rate of 0.5%, our BN achieves 
            an improved true positive rate of 61%, compared to a 
            previously reported 50% on the same dataset using support 
            vector machines (SVMs). Incorporating several novel 
            discriminative features such as intronic splicing regulatory 
            elements leads to the improvement. Features related to mRNA 
            secondary structure increase the prediction performance, 
            corroborating previous findings that secondary structures 
            are important for exon recognition. Random labelling tests 
            rule out overfitting. Cross-validation on another dataset 
            confirms the increased performance. When using the same 
            dataset and the same set of features, the BN matches the 
            performance of an SVM in earlier literature. Remarkably, we 
            could show that about half of the exons which are labelled 
            constitutive but receive a high probability of being 
            alternative by the BN, are in fact alternative exons 
            according to the latest EST data. Finally, we predict exon 
            skipping without using conservation-based features, and 
            achieve a true positive rate of 29% at a false positive rate 
            of 0.5%. CONCLUSION: BNs can be used to achieve accurate 
            identification of alternative exons and provide clues about 
            possible dependencies between relevant features. The 
            near-identical performance of the BN and SVM when using the 
            same features shows that good classification depends more on 
            features than on the choice of classifier. Conservation 
            based features continue to be the most informative, and 
            hence distinguishing alternative exons from constitutive 
            ones without using conservation based features remains a 
            challenging problem.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subtle alternative splicing events involving 
            tandem splice sites separated by a short (2-12 nucleotides) 
            distance are frequent and evolutionarily widespread in 
            eukaryotes, and a major contributor to the complexity of 
            transcriptomes and proteomes. However, these events have 
            been either omitted altogether in databases on alternative 
            splicing, or only the cases of experimentally confirmed 
            alternative splicing have been reported. Thus, a database 
            which covers all confirmed cases of subtle alternative 
            splicing as well as the numerous putative tandem splice 
            sites (which might be confirmed once more transcript data 
            becomes available), and allows to search for tandem splice 
            sites with specific features and download the results, is a 
            valuable resource for targeted experimental studies and 
            large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites. 
            Towards this goal we recently set up TassDB (Tandem Splice 
            Site DataBase, version 1), which stores data about 
            alternative splicing events at tandem splice sites separated 
            by 3 nt in eight species. DESCRIPTION: We have substantially 
            revised and extended TassDB. The currently available version 
            2 contains extensive information about tandem splice sites 
            separated by 2-12 nt for the human and mouse transcriptomes 
            including data on the conservation of the tandem motifs in 
            five vertebrates. TassDB2 offers a user-friendly interface 
            to search for specific genes or for genes containing tandem 
            splice sites with specific features as well as the 
            possibility to download result datasets. For example, users 
            can search for cases of alternative splicing where the 
            proportion of EST/mRNA evidence supporting the minor isoform 
            exceeds a specific threshold, or where the difference in 
            splice site scores is specified by the user. The predicted 
            impact of each event on the protein is also reported, along 
            with information about being a putative target for the 
            nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. Links are provided to 
            the UCSC genome browser and other external resources.

            predictions of alternative acceptor usage reported better 
            results for acceptors separated by larger distances, than 
            for NAGNAGs. To improve the latter, we aimed at the use of 
            Bayesian networks (BN), and extensive experimental 
            validation of the predictions. Using carefully constructed 
            training and test datasets, a balanced sensitivity and 
            specificity of >or=92% was achieved. A BN trained on the 
            combined dataset was then used to make predictions, and 81% 
            (38/47) of the experimentally tested predictions were 
            verified. Using a BN learned on human data on six other 
            genomes, we show that while the performance for the 
            vertebrate genomes matches that achieved on human data, 
            there is a slight drop for Drosophila and worm. Lastly, 
            using the prediction accuracy according to experimental 
            validation, we estimate the number of yet undiscovered 
            alternative NAGNAGs. State of the art classifiers can 
            produce highly accurate prediction of AS at NAGNAGs, 
            indicating that we have identified the major features of the 
            'NAGNAG-splicing code' within the splice site and its 
            immediate neighborhood. Our results suggest that the 
            mechanism behind NAGNAG AS is simple, stochastic, and 
            conserved among vertebrates and beyond.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing (AS) involving tandem 
            acceptors that are separated by three nucleotides (NAGNAG) 
            is an evolutionarily widespread class of AS, which is well 
            studied in Homo sapiens (human) and Mus musculus (mouse). It 
            has also been shown to be common in the model seed plants 
            Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice). In one of the 
            first studies involving sequence-based prediction of AS in 
            plants, we performed a genome-wide identification and 
            characterization of NAGNAG AS in the model plant 
            Physcomitrella patens, a moss. RESULTS: Using Sanger data, 
            we found 295 alternatively used NAGNAG acceptors in P. 
            patens. Using 31 features and training and test datasets of 
            constitutive and alternative NAGNAGs, we trained a 
            classifier to predict the splicing outcome at NAGNAG tandem 
            splice sites (alternative splicing, constitutive at the 
            first acceptor, or constitutive at the second acceptor). Our 
            classifier achieved a balanced specificity and sensitivity 
            of >or= 89%. Subsequently, a classifier trained exclusively 
            on data well supported by transcript evidence was used to 
            make genome-wide predictions of NAGNAG splicing outcomes. By 
            generation of more transcript evidence from a 
            next-generation sequencing platform (Roche 454), we found 
            additional evidence for NAGNAG AS, with altogether 664 
            alternative NAGNAGs being detected in P. patens using all 
            currently available transcript evidence. The 454 data also 
            enabled us to validate the predictions of the classifier, 
            with 64% (80/125) of the well-supported cases of AS being 
            predicted correctly. CONCLUSION: NAGNAG AS is just as common 
            in the moss P. patens as it is in the seed plants A. 
            thaliana and O. sativa (but not conserved on the level of 
            orthologous introns), and can be predicted with high 
            accuracy. The most informative features are the nucleotides 
            in the NAGNAG and in its immediate vicinity, along with the 
            splice sites scores, as found earlier for NAGNAG AS in 
            animals. Our results suggest that the mechanism behind 
            NAGNAG AS in plants is similar to that in animals and is 
            largely dependent on the splice site and its immediate 
            neighborhood.}

            which the pqsR gene is translationally coupled. Expression 
            of phrS requires the oxygen-responsive regulator ANR. Thus,

            simultaneous alignment and folding, are now readily 
            applicable. Such approaches, however, compare RNAs with 
            respect to a simultaneously predicted, single, nested 
            consensus structure. To make multiple alignment of RNAs 
            available in cases, where this limitation of the standard 
            approach is critical, we introduce a web server that 
            provides a complete and convenient interface to the RNA 
            structure alignment tool 'CARNA'. This tool uniquely 
            supports RNAs with multiple conserved structures per RNA and 
            aligns pseudoknots intrinsically; these features are highly 
            desirable for aligning riboswitches, RNAs with conserved 
            folding pathways, or pseudoknots. We represent structural 
            input and output information as base pair probability dot 
            plots; this provides large flexibility in the input, ranging 
            from fixed structures to structure ensembles, and enables 
            immediate visual analysis of the results. In contrast to 
            conventional Sankoff-style approaches, 'CARNA' optimizes all 
            structural similarities in the input simultaneously, for 
            example across an entire RNA structure ensemble. Even 
            compared with already costly Sankoff-style alignment, 
            'CARNA' solves an intrinsically much harder problem by 
            applying advanced, constraint-based, algorithmic techniques. 
            Although 'CARNA' is specialized to the alignment of RNAs 
            with several conserved structures, its performance on RNAs 
            in general is on par with state-of-the-art general-purpose 
            RNA alignment tools, as we show in a Bralibase 2.1 
            benchmark. The web server is freely available at

            its genome in the WT background; the resulting cleavage of 
            the genome is repaired by homologous recombination restoring 
            the WT version. In mutant Haloferax strains with enhanced 
            self-targeting, cell fitness decreases and 
            microhomology-mediated end joining becomes active, 
            generating deletions in the targeted gene. Here we use 
            self-targeting to investigate adaptation in H. volcanii 
            CRISPR-Cas type I-B. We show that self-targeting and genome 
            breakage events that are induced by self-targeting, such as 
            those catalyzed by active transposases, can generate DNA 
            fragments that are used by the CRISPR-Cas adaptation 
            machinery for integration into the CRISPR loci. Low cellular 
            concentrations of self-targeting crRNAs resulted in 
            acquisition of large numbers of spacers originating from the 
            entire genomic DNA. In contrast, high concentrations of 
            self-targeting crRNAs resulted in lower acquisition that was 
            mostly centered on the targeting site. Furthermore, we 
            observed naive spacer acquisition at a low level in WT 
            Haloferax cells and with higher efficiency upon 
            overexpression of the Cas proteins Cas1, Cas2, and Cas4. 
            Taken together, these findings indicate that naive 
            adaptation is a regulated process in H. volcanii that 
            operates at low basal levels and is induced by DNA breaks.}

            Objectives: This study aimed to compare and integrate complementary methods of investigating 
            intra-annual wood formation dynamics to gain a better understanding of the endogenous and 
            environmental control of tree-ring development and the impact of anticipated climatic changes on forest 
            growth and productivity. Materials and Methods: We performed an integrated analysis of xylogenesis 
            observations, quantitative wood anatomy and point-dendrometer measurements of Norway spruce 
            (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees growing along an elevational gradient in south-western Germany during 
            a growing season with an anomalous dry June followed by an extraordinary humid July. Results: 
            Strong endogenous control of tree-ring formation was suggested at the highest elevation where the 
            decreasing rates of tracheid enlargement and wall thickening during drought were effectively compensated 
            by increased cell differentiation duration. A shift to environmental control of tree-ring 
            formation during drought was indicated at the lowest elevation, where we detected absence of compensatory 
            mechanisms, eventually stimulating the formation of an intra-annual density fluctuation. Transient 
            drought stress in June also led to bimodal patterns and decreasing daily rates of stem 
            radial displacement, radial xylem growth and woody biomass production. Comparing xylogenesis 
            data with dendrometer measurements showed ambivalent results and it appears that with decreasing 
            daily rates of radial xylem growth, the signal-to-noise ratio in dendrometer time series between 
            growth and fluctuations of tree water status becomes increasingly detrimental. Conclusions: Our 
            study provides new perspectives into the complex interplay between rates and durations of tracheid 
            development during dry-wet cycles, and thereby contributes to an improved and mechanistic understanding

This study has the aim to evaluate and to quantify synergetic potentials emerging from a combination of current state of the art techniques used to monitor intra-annual wood formation processes. Norway spruce trees were studied in detail during the growing season 2009 with weekly sampling of microcores, high resolution point-dendrometers and wood anatomical analysis. The combination of the applied techniques allowed us to convert the spatial scales of radial tracheid diameter profiles to seasonal time scales and to synchronize fluctuations in intra-annual cell diameter profiles. This spatiotemporal information was used to validate the recently introduced software MICA (Multiple interval-based curve alignment). In comparison to the conventional approach of averaging profiles of tree ring variables, the MICA aligned profiles exhibit a significantly higher synchronicity of the averaged data points. We also demonstrate two new features in the MICA application that enable to extrapolate spatiotemporal information between intra-annual profiles for the construction of robust mean (consensus) profiles that are representative for the population dynamics. By using a set of complementary techniques in an integrated approach, this study highlights a new methodological framework that can contribute to a better understanding of the environmental control of wood formation during the growing season.}

            detrimental and can result in cell death. For protection 
            against invasion, prokaryotes have developed several defence 
            mechanisms, which take effect at all stages of infection; an 
            example is the recently discovered CRISPR (clustered 
            regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-Cas 
            (CRISPR-associated) immune system. This defence system 
            directly degrades invading genetic material and is present 
            in almost all archaea and many bacteria. Current data 
            indicate a large variety of mechanistic molecular 
            approaches. Although almost all archaea carry this defence 
            weapon, only a few archaeal systems have been fully 
            characterized. In the present paper, we summarize the 
            prerequisites for the detection and degradation of invaders 
            in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. H. volcanii 
            encodes a subtype I-B CRISPR-Cas system and the defence can 
            be triggered by a plasmid-based invader. Six different 
            target-interference motifs are recognized by the Haloferax 
            defence and a 9-nt non-contiguous seed sequence is 
            essential. The repeat sequence has the potential to fold 
            into a minimal stem-loop structure, which is conserved in 
            haloarchaea and might be recognized by the Cas6 
            endoribonuclease during the processing of CRISPR loci into 
            mature crRNA (CRISPR RNA). Individual crRNA species were 
            present in very different concentrations according to an 
            RNA-Seq analysis and many were unable to trigger a 
            successful defence reaction. Recognition of the plasmid 
            invader does not depend on its copy number, but instead 
            results indicate a dependency on the type of origin present 
            on the plasmid.}

            modulated by trans-acting RBPs. We measure U2AF2 affinities 
            at hundreds of binding sites and compare in vitro and in

            that trans-acting RBPs extensively regulate U2AF2 binding in 
            vivo, including enhanced recruitment to 3' splice sites and 
            clearance of introns. Using machine learning, we identify 
            and experimentally validate novel trans-acting RBPs 
            (including FUBP1, CELF6, and PCBP1) that modulate U2AF2

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Despite some degeneracy of sequence 
            signals that govern splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs, it is 
            an accepted rule that U2-dependent introns exhibit the 3' 
            terminal dinucleotide AG. Intrigued by anecdotal evidence 
            for functional non-AG 3' splice sites, we carried out a 
            human genome-wide screen. RESULTS: We identified TG 
            dinucleotides functioning as alternative 3' splice sites in 
            36 human genes. The TG-derived splice variants were 
            experimentally validated with a success rate of 92%. 
            Interestingly, ratios of alternative splice variants are 
            tissue-specific for several introns. TG splice sites and 
            their flanking intron sequences are substantially conserved 
            between orthologous vertebrate genes, even between human and 
            frog, indicating functional relevance. Remarkably, TG splice 
            sites are exclusively found as alternative 3' splice sites, 
            never as the sole 3' splice site for an intron, and we 
            observed a distance constraint for TG-AG splice site 
            tandems. CONCLUSION: Since TGs splice sites are exclusively 
            found as alternative 3' splice sites, the U2 spliceosome 
            apparently accomplishes perfect specificity for 3' AGs at an 
            early splicing step, but may choose 3' TGs during later 
            steps. Given the tiny fraction of TG 3' splice sites 
            compared to the vast amount of non-viable TGs, cis-acting 
            sequence signals must significantly contribute to splice 
            site definition. Thus, we consider TG-AG 3' splice site 
            tandems as promising subjects for studies on the mechanisms 
            of 3' splice site selection.}

Here we show that deletions of a sequence on human chromosome 16 that we term the intestine-critical region (ICR) cause intractable congenital diarrhoea in infants. Reporter assays in transgenic mice show that the ICR contains a regulatory sequence that activates transcription during the development of the gastrointestinal system. Targeted deletion of the ICR in mice caused symptoms that recapitulated the human condition. Transcriptome analysis revealed that an unannotated open reading frame (Percc1) flanks the regulatory sequence, and the expression of this gene was lost in the developing gut of mice that lacked the ICR. Percc1-knockout mice displayed phenotypes similar to those observed upon ICR deletion in mice and patients, whereas an ICR-driven Percc1 transgene was sufficient to rescue the phenotypes found in mice that lacked the ICR. Together, our results identify a gene that is critical for intestinal function and underscore the need for targeted in vivo studies to interpret the growing number of clinical genetic findings that do not affect known protein-coding genes.}}

            Recently, many researchers have been focusing on the definition of neural networks for graphs. The basic component for many of these approaches remains the graph convolution idea proposed almost a decade ago. In this paper, we extend this basic component, following an intuition derived from the well-known convolutional filters over multi-dimensional tensors. In particular, we derive a simple, efficient and effective way to introduce a hyper-parameter on graph convolutions that influences the filter size, i.e., its receptive field over the considered graph. We show with experimental results on real-world graph datasets that the proposed graph convolutional filter improves the predictive performance of Deep Graph Convolutional Networks.}

            raw reads have to be trimmed and mapped to the genome. This 
            step has to be specifically adapted for each CLIP-seq 
            protocol. The next step is peak calling, which is required 
            to remove unspecific signals and to determine bona fide 
            protein binding sites on target RNAs. Here, both 
            protocol-specific approaches as well as generic peak callers 
            are available. Despite some peak callers being more widely 
            used, each peak caller has its specific assets and 
            drawbacks, and it might be advantageous to compare the 
            results of several methods. Although peak calling is often 
            the final step in many CLIP-seq publications, an important 
            follow-up task is the determination of binding models from 
            CLIP-seq data. This is central because CLIP-seq experiments 
            are highly dependent on the transcriptional state of the

            determines the most likely splice variant, and merges 
            results for any number of datasets to obtain a comprehensive 
            collection of transcript context binding sites. AVAILABILITY

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed 
            by next-generation sequencing (CLIP-seq) is the 
            state-of-the-art technique used to experimentally determine 
            transcriptome-wide binding sites of RNA-binding proteins 
            (RBPs). However, it relies on gene expression, which can be 
            highly variable between conditions and thus cannot provide a 
            complete picture of the RBP binding landscape. This creates 
            a demand for computational methods to predict missing 
            binding sites. Although there exist various methods using 
            traditional machine learning and lately also deep learning, 
            we encountered several problems: many of these are not well 
            documented or maintained, making them difficult to install 
            and use, or are not even available. In addition, there can 
            be efficiency issues, as well as little flexibility 
            regarding options or supported features. RESULTS: Here, we 
            present RNAProt, an efficient and feature-rich computational 
            RBP binding site prediction framework based on recurrent 
            neural networks. We compare RNAProt with 1 traditional 
            machine learning approach and 2 deep-learning methods, 
            demonstrating its state-of-the-art predictive performance 
            and better run time efficiency. We further show that its 
            implemented visualizations capture known binding preferences 
            and thus can help to understand what is learned. Since 
            RNAProt supports various additional features (including 
            user-defined features, which no other tool offers), we also 
            present their influence on benchmark set performance. 
            Finally, we show the benefits of incorporating additional 
            features, specifically structure information, when learning 
            the binding sites of an hairpin loop binding RBP. 
            CONCLUSIONS: RNAProt provides a complete framework for RBP 
            binding site predictions, from data set generation over 
            model training to the evaluation of binding preferences and 
            prediction. It offers state-of-the-art predictive 
            performance, as well as superior run time efficiency, while 
            at the same time supporting more features and input types 
            than any other tool available so far. RNAProt is easy to 
            install and use, comes with comprehensive documentation, and 
            is accompanied by informative statistics and visualizations. 
            All this makes RNAProt a valuable tool to apply in future 
            RBP binding site research.}

            hydrophobic collapse. Given a protein sequence, the first stage of the
            approach produces compact protein structures with the maximal number
            of contacts among hydrophobic monomers, using the CPSP tools for
            optimal structure prediction in the HP model. The second stage uses
            those compact structures as starting points to further optimize the protein
            structure for the input sequence by employing simulated annealing
            local search and a 20 amino acid pairwise interactions energy function.
            Experimental results with PDB sequences show that compact structures
            produced by the CPSP tools are up to two orders of magnitude better,
            in terms of the pairwise energy function, than randomly generated ones.
            Also, initializing simulated annealing with these compact structures, produces
            better structures in fewer iterations than initializing with random
            structures. Hence, the proposed two-stage optimization outperforms a
            local search procedure based on simulated annealing alone.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the advances in next-generation sequencing 
            technologies, it is possible to determine RNA-RNA 
            interaction and RNA structure predictions on a genome-wide 
            level. The reads from these experiments usually are 
            chimeric, with each arm generated from one of the 
            interaction partners. Owing to short read lengths, often 
            these sequenced arms ambiguously map to multiple locations. 
            Thus, inferring the origin of these can be quite 
            complicated. Here we present ChiRA, a generic framework for 
            sensitive annotation of these chimeric reads, which in turn 
            can be used to predict the sequenced hybrids. RESULTS: 
            Grouping reference loci on the basis of aligned common reads 
            and quantification improved the handling of the multi-mapped 
            reads in contrast to common strategies such as the selection 
            of the longest hit or a random choice among all hits. On 
            benchmark data ChiRA improved the number of correct 
            alignments to the reference up to 3-fold. It is shown that 
            the genes that belong to the common read loci share the same 
            protein families or similar pathways. In published data, 
            ChiRA could detect 3 times more new interactions compared to 
            existing approaches. In addition, ChiRAViz can be used to 
            visualize and filter large chimeric datasets intuitively. 
            CONCLUSION: ChiRA tool suite provides a complete analysis 
            and visualization framework along with ready-to-use Galaxy 
            workflows and tutorials for RNA-RNA interactome and 
            structurome datasets. Common read loci built by ChiRA can 
            rescue multi-mapped reads on paralogous genes without 
            requiring any information on gene relations. We showed that 
            ChiRA is sensitive in detecting new RNA-RNA interactions 
            from published RNA-RNA interactome datasets.}

            cellular processes such as RNA splicing, translation, gene 
            regulation. However the vast majority of ncRNAs still have 
            no functional annotation. One prominent approach for 
            putative function assignment is clustering of transcripts 
            according to sequence and secondary structure. However 
            sequence information is changed by post-transcriptional 
            modifications, and secondary structure is only a proxy for 
            the true 3D conformation of the RNA polymer. A different 
            type of information that does not suffer from these issues 
            and that can be used for the detection of RNA classes, is 
            the pattern of processing and its traces in small RNA-seq 
            reads data. Here we introduce BlockClust, an efficient 
            approach to detect transcripts with similar processing 
            patterns. We propose a novel way to encode expression 
            profiles in compact discrete structures, which can then be 
            processed using fast graph-kernel techniques. We perform 
            both unsupervised clustering and develop family specific 
            discriminative models; finally we show how the proposed

            that allows users to easily organize, retrieve and share 
            such datasets. Here, we describe the integration of refgenie 
            into the Galaxy platform. Server administrators are able to 
            configure Galaxy to make use of reference datasets made 
            available on a refgenie instance. In addition, a Galaxy Data 
            Manager tool has been developed to provide a graphical 
            interface to refgenie's remote reference retrieval 
            functionality. A large collection of reference datasets has 
            also been made available using the CVMFS (CernVM File 
            System) repository from GalaxyProject.org, with mirrors 
            across the USA, Canada, Europe and Australia, enabling easy 
            use outside of Galaxy. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The 
            ability of Galaxy to use refgenie assets was added to the 
            core Galaxy framework in version 22.01, which is available 
            from https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy under the

As part of the ongoing bacterial-phage arms race, CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria clear invading phages whereas anti-CRISPR proteins (Acrs) in phages inhibit CRISPR defenses. Known Acrs have proven extremely diverse, complicating their identification. Here, we report a deep learning algorithm for Acr identification that revealed an Acr against type VI-B CRISPR-Cas systems. The algorithm predicted numerous putative Acrs spanning almost all CRISPR-Cas types and subtypes, including over 7,000 putative type IV and VI Acrs not predicted by other algorithms. By performing a cell-free screen for Acr hits against type VI-B systems, we identified a potent inhibitor of Cas13b nucleases we named AcrVIB1. AcrVIB1 blocks Cas13b-mediated defense against a targeted plasmid and lytic phage, and its inhibitory function principally occurs upstream of ribonucleoprotein complex formation. Overall, our work helps expand the known Acr universe, aiding our understanding of the bacteria-phage arms race and the use of Acrs to control CRISPR technologies.}

Exposure of microglia and macrophages to certain miRNA classes released from apoptotic neurons resulted in the sequence-specific production of distinct cytokines/ chemokines and increased phagocytic activity. Out of those miRNAs miR-100-5p and miR-298-5p, which have consistently been linked to neurodegenerative diseases, entered microglia, located to their endosomes, and directly bound to human TLR8. The miRNA-TLR interaction required novel sequence features, but no specific structure formation of mature miRNA. As a consequence of miR-100-5p- and miR-298-5p-induced TLR activation, cortical neurons underwent cell-autonomous apoptosis. Presence of miR-100-5p and miR-298-5p in cerebrospinal fluid led to neurodegeneration and microglial accumulation in the murine cerebral cortex through TLR7 signaling. 
            Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that specific miRNAs are released from apoptotic cortical neurons, serve as endogenous TLR7/8 ligands, and thereby trigger further neuronal apoptosis in the CNS. Our findings underline the recently discovered role of miRNAs as extracellular signaling molecules, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration.

            (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
            coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is marked by thromboembolic 
            events and an inflammatory response throughout the body, 
            including the brain. METHODS: Employing the machine learning 
            approach BrainDead we systematically screened for SARS-CoV-2 
            genome-derived single-stranded (ss) RNA fragments with high 
            potential to activate the viral RNA-sensing innate immune 
            receptors Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and/or TLR8. Analyzing 
            HEK TLR7/8 reporter cells we tested such RNA fragments with 
            respect to their potential to induce activation of human 
            TLR7 and TLR8 and to activate human macrophages, as well as 
            iPSC-derived human microglia, the resident immune cells in 
            the brain. RESULTS: We experimentally validated several 
            sequence-specific RNA fragment candidates out of the 
            SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments predicted in silico as activators 
            of human TLR7 and TLR8. Moreover, these SARS-CoV-2 ssRNAs 
            induced cytokine release from human macrophages and 
            iPSC-derived human microglia in a sequence- and 
            species-specific fashion. DISCUSSION: Our findings determine 
            TLR7 and TLR8 as key sensors of SARS-CoV-2-derived ssRNAs 
            and may deepen our understanding of the mechanisms how this 
            virus triggers, but also modulates an inflammatory response

abstract = {PURPOSE: Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in aqueous humor 
            were suggested to have a role in transcellular signaling and 
            may serve as disease biomarkers. The authors adopted 
            next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques to further 
            characterize the miRNA profile in single samples of 60 to 80 
            muL human aqueous humor. METHODS: Samples were obtained at 
            the outset of cataract surgery in nine independent, 
            otherwise healthy eyes. Four samples were used to extract 
            RNA and generate sequencing libraries, followed by an 
            adapter-driven amplification step, electrophoretic size 
            selection, sequencing, and data analysis. Five samples were 
            used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) validation of NGS results. 
            Published NGS data on circulating miRNAs in blood were 
            analyzed in comparison. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight 
            miRNAs were consistently detected by NGS in all four 
            samples; an additional 59 miRNAs were present in at least 
            three samples. The aqueous humor miRNA profile shows some 
            overlap with published NGS-derived inventories of 
            circulating miRNAs in blood plasma with high prevalence of 
            human miR-451a, -21, and -16. In contrast to blood, miR-184, 
            -4448, -30a, -29a, -29c, -19a, -30d, -205, -24, -22, and 
            -3074 were detected among the 20 most prevalent miRNAs in 
            aqueous humor. Relative expression patterns of miR-451a, 
            -202, and -144 suggested by NGS were confirmed by qPCR. 
            CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrate the feasibility of miRNA 
            analysis by NGS in small individual aqueous humor samples. 
            Intraocular cells as well as blood plasma contribute to the 
            extracellular aqueous humor miRNome. The data suggest 
            possible roles of miRNA in intraocular cell adhesion and 
            signaling by TGF-beta and Wnt, which are important in 
            intraocular pressure regulation and glaucoma.}

abstract = {A novel archaeal lytic virus targeting species of the genus 
            Methanosarcina was isolated using Methanosarcina mazei 
            strain Go1 as host. Due to its spherical morphology the 
            virus was designated Methanosarcinaspherical virus (MetSV). 
            Molecular analysis demonstrated that MetSV contains double 
            stranded linear DNA with a genome size of 10,567 bp 
            containing 22 open reading frames (ORFs) all oriented in the 
            same direction. Functions were predicted for some of these 
            ORFs, i. e. like DNA polymerase, ATPase, DNA-binding 
            protein, as well as envelope (structural) protein. 
            MetSV-derived spacers in CRISPR loci were detected in 
            several published Methanosarcina draft genomes using 
            bioinformatic tools, revealing the potential PAM motif 
            (TTA/T). Transcription and expression of several predicted 
            viral ORFs were validated by RT-PCR, PAGE analysis and LC-MS 
            based proteomics. Analysis of core lipids by APCI mass 
            spectrometry showed that MetSV and M. mazei both contain 
            archaeol and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether without 
            cyclopentane moiety (GDGT-0). The MetSV host range is 
            limited to Methanosarcina strains growing as single cells 
            (M. mazei, M. bakeri and M. soligelidi). In contrast, 
            strains growing as sarcina-like aggregates were apparently 
            protected from infection. Heterogeneity related to 
            morphology phases in M. mazei cultures allowed acquisition 
            of resistance to MetSV after challenge by growing as 
            sarcina-like aggregates. CRISPR/Cas mediated resistance was 
            excluded since neither of the two CRISPR arrays showed 
            MetSV-derived spacer acquisition. Based on these findings, 
            we propose that changing the morphology from single cells to 
            sarcina-like aggregates upon rearrangement of the envelope 
            structure prevents infection and subsequent lysis by 
            MetSV.IMPORTANCE Methanoarchaea are among the most abundant 
            organisms on the planet since they are present in high 
            numbers in major anaerobic environments. They convert 
            various carbon sources e.g. acetate, methylamines or 
            methanol to methane and carbon dioxide, thus they have a 
            significant impact on the emission of major greenhouse 
            gases. Today very little is known about viruses specifically 
            infecting methanoarchaea, which most probably impact the 
            abundance of methanoarchaea in microbial consortia. Here we 
            characterize the first identified Methanosarcina infecting 
            virus (MetSV) and show a mechanism for acquiring resistance 
            against MetSV. Based on our results we propose that growth 
            as sarcina-like aggregates prevents infection and subsequent 
            lysis. These findings allow new insights into virus-host 
            relationship in methanogenic community structures, their 
            dynamics and their phase heterogeneity. Moreover, the 
            availability of a specific virus provides new possibilities 
            to deepen our knowledge on defence mechanisms of potential 
            hosts and offers tools for genetic manipulation.}

abstract = {Rett syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in MECP2. However, mutations in FOXG1 cause a less frequent form of atypical Rett syndrome, called FOXG1 syndrome. FOXG1 is a key transcription factor crucial for forebrain development, where it maintains the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Using genome-wide small RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we identified that FOXG1 affects the biogenesis of miR200b/a/429 and interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX5/p68. Both FOXG1 and DDX5 associate with the microprocessor complex, whereby DDX5 recruits FOXG1 to DROSHA. RNA-Seq analyses of Foxg1cre/+ hippocampi and N2a cells overexpressing miR200 family members identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) as a target of miR200 in neural cells. PRKAR2B inhibits postsynaptic functions by attenuating protein kinase A (PKA) activity; thus, increased PRKAR2B levels may contribute to neuronal dysfunctions in FOXG1 syndrome. Our data suggest that FOXG1 regulates PRKAR2B expression both on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.}

            contacts. Here, we use and strengthen upper bounds
            presented earlier. [Backofen, Will: CPM2001] The
            resulting structure prediction algorithm (including
            previous work [Backofen, Will: CPM2001, Backofen,
            Will: CP2001]) handles sequences of sizes in the
            range of real proteins fast, i.e. we predict a first
            structure often within a few minutes. The algorithm
            is the first exact one for the FCC, besides full
            enumeration which is impracticable for chain lengths
            greater than about 15. We tested the algorithm
            succesfully up to sequence length of 160, which is
            far beyond the capabilities even of previous
            heuristic approaches.}

abstract = {Recent genome-wide computational screens that search
            for conservation of RNA secondary structure in whole
            genome alignments (WGAs) have predicted thousands of
            structural non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The sensitivity
            of such approaches, however, is limited due to their
            reliance on sequence-based whole- genome aligners,
            which regularly misalign structural ncRNAs. This
            suggests that many more structural ncRNAs may remain
            undetected. Structure-based align- ment, which could
            increase the sensitivity, has been prohibitive for
            genome- wide screens due to its extreme
            computational costs. Breaking this barrier, we
            present the pipeline REAPR (RE-Alignment for de novo
            Prediction of structural ncRNA) that realigns whole
            genomes based on RNA sequence and structure and then
            evaluates the realignments for potential structural
            ncRNAs with a ncRNA predictor such as RNAz 2.0. For
            efficiency of the pipeline, we develop a novel
            banding realignment algorithm for the RNA multiple
            alignment tool LocARNA.  This allows us to perform
            very fast structure-based realignment within limited
            deviation of the original multiple alignment from
            the WGA. We apply REAPR to the complete twelve
            Drosophila WGAs to predict ncRNAs across all these
            Drosophila species. Compared to direct prediction
            from the original WGA at the same False Discovery
            Rate (FDR), we predict twice as many high-confidence
            ncRNA candidates in D.melanogaster while less than
            doubling the run-time. As a novelty in ncRNA
            prediction, we control the FDR, going beyond the
            usual a posteriori FDR estimation. Applying the
            sequence-based alignment tool Muscle for
            realignment, we demonstrate that structure-based
            methods are necessary for effective prediction of
            originally misaligned ncRNAs. Comparing to recent
            screens of Drosophila and ENCODE we show that REAPR
            outperforms the widely-used de novo predictors RNAz,
            EvoFold, and CMfinder. Finally, we reveal, with high
            confidence, a putative structural motif in the long
            ncRNA roX1 of D.melanogaster, known to regulate X
            chromosome dosage compensation in male
            ies. Interestingly, we recapitulate the Drosophila
            phylogeny, based on co-predicted ncRNAs across all
            genomes.}

            snoRNAs, functional commonalities define classes of RNAs
            that are characterized by structural similarities, and
            typically consist ofmultiple RNA families. Recent advances
            in high-throughput transcriptomics and comparative genomics
            have produced very large sets of putative non-coding RNAs
            and regulatory RNA signals. For many ofthem, evidence for
            stabilizing selection acting on their secondary structures
            has been derived, and at least approximate models of their
            structures have been computed. The overwhelming majority of
            these hypo-thetical RNAs cannot be assigned to established

            several RNA families, including microRNA and snoRNA

            highly accurate prediction of ncRNA boundaries and 
            discrimination of promising candidate ncRNAs from weak 
            predictions. Existing methods struggle with these goals 
            because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence 
            alignments, which regularly misalign RNA structure and 
            therefore do not support identification of structural 
            similarities. To overcome this limitation, we compute 
            columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on 
            sequence and structure similarity; we refer to these 
            structure-based alignment reliabilities as STARs. The 
            columnwise STARs of alignments, or STAR profiles, provide a 
            versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of

            the widely used ncRNA gene finder RNAz by a factor of 3 from 
            a median deviation of 47 to 13 nt. Post-processing RNAz

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-Seq experiments have revealed a multitude 
            of novel ncRNAs. The gold standard for their analysis based 
            on simultaneous alignment and folding suffers from extreme 
            time complexity of [Formula: see text]. Subsequently, 
            numerous faster 'Sankoff-style' approaches have been 
            suggested. Commonly, the performance of such methods relies 
            on sequence-based heuristics that restrict the search space 
            to optimal or near-optimal sequence alignments; however, the 
            accuracy of sequence-based methods breaks down for RNAs with 
            sequence identities below 60%. Alignment approaches like 
            LocARNA that do not require sequence-based heuristics, have 
            been limited to high complexity ([Formula: see text] quartic 
            time). RESULTS: Breaking this barrier, we introduce the 
            novel Sankoff-style algorithm 'sparsified prediction and 
            alignment of RNAs based on their structure ensembles 
            (SPARSE)', which runs in quadratic time without 
            sequence-based heuristics. To achieve this low complexity, 
            on par with sequence alignment algorithms, SPARSE features 
            strong sparsification based on structural properties of the 
            RNA ensembles. Following PMcomp, SPARSE gains further 
            speed-up from lightweight energy computation. Although all 
            existing lightweight Sankoff-style methods restrict 
            Sankoff's original model by disallowing loop deletions and 
            insertions, SPARSE transfers the Sankoff algorithm to the 
            lightweight energy model completely for the first time. 
            Compared with LocARNA, SPARSE achieves similar alignment and 
            better folding quality in significantly less time (speedup: 
            3.7). At similar run-time, it aligns low sequence identity 
            instances substantially more accurate than RAF, which uses 
            sequence-based heuristics. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The search for distant homologs has become an 
            import issue in genome annotation. A particular difficulty 
            is posed by divergent homologs that have lost recognizable 
            sequence similarity. This same problem also arises in the 
            recognition of novel members of large classes of RNAs such 
            as snoRNAsor microRNAs that consist of families unrelated by 
            common descent. Current homology search tools for structured 
            RNAs are either based entirely on sequence similarity (such 
            as blast or hmmer) or combine sequence and secondary 
            structure. The most prominent example of the latter class of 
            tools is Infernal. Alternatives are descriptor-based 
            methods. In most practical applications published to-date, 
            however, the information contained in covariance models or 
            manually prescribed search patterns is dominated by sequence 
            information. Here we ask two related questions: (1) Is 
            secondary structure alone informative for homology search 
            and the detection of novel members of RNA classes? (2) To 
            what extent is the thermodynamic propensity of the target 
            sequence to fold into the correct secondary structure 
            helpful for this task? RESULTS: Sequence-structure alignment 
            can be used as an alternative search strategy. In this 
            scenario, the query consists of a base pairing probability 
            matrix, which can be derived either from a single sequence 
            or from a multiple alignment representing a set of known 
            representatives. Sequence information can be optionally 
            added to the query. The target sequence is pre-processed to 
            obtain local base pairing probabilities. As a search engine 
            we devised a semi-global scanning variant of LocARNA's 
            algorithm for sequence-structure alignment. The LocARNAscan 
            tool is optimized for speed and low memory consumption. In 
            benchmarking experiments on artificial data we observe that 
            the inclusion of thermodynamic stability is helpful, albeit 
            only in a regime of extremely low sequence information in 
            the query. We observe, furthermore, that the sensitivity is 
            bounded in particular by the limited accuracy of the 
            predicted local structures of the target sequence. 
            CONCLUSIONS: Although we demonstrate that a purely 
            structure-based homology search is feasible in principle, it 
            is unlikely to outperform tools such as Infernal in most 
            application scenarios, where a substantial amount of 
            sequence information is typically available. The LocARNAscan 
            approach will profit, however, from high throughput methods 
            to determine RNA secondary structure. In transcriptomewide 
            applications, such methods will provide accurate structure 
            annotations on the target side. AVAILABILITY: Source code of

abstract = {Motivation: There is increasing evidence of
            pervasive transcription, resulting in hundreds of
            thousands of ncRNAs of unknown function. Standard
            computational analysis tasks for inferring
            functional annotations like clustering require fast
            and accurate RNA comparisons based on sequence and
            structure similarity.  The gold standard for the
            latter is Sankoff’s algorithm, which simultaneously
            aligns and folds RNAs. Because of its extreme time
            complexity of $O(n^6)$, numerous faster
            "Sankoff-style" approaches have been
            suggested. Several such approaches introduce
            heuristics based on sequence alignment, which
            compromises the alignment quality for RNAs with
            sequence identities below $60\%$. Avoiding such
            heuristics, as e.g. in LocARNA, has been assumed to
            prohibit time complexities better than $O(n^4)$,
            which strongly limits large-scale applications.
            Results: Breaking this barrier, we introduce SPARSE
            (Sparse Prediction and Alignment of RNAs using
            Structure Ensembles), a novel quadratic time
            Sankoff-style approach that does not rely on
            sequence-based heuristics but employs structural
            properties of RNA ensembles; its $O(n^2)$ complexity
            matches the one of sequence alignment. The approach
            is based on a novel lightweight Sankoff-style
            alignment model, for which we introduce the
            algorithm PARSE. For the first time it transfers the
            Sankoff-model completely to a lightweight energy
            model; thus, it is more expressive than all previous
            lightweight methods, which inherit the PMcomp
            model. In comparison to LocARNA and similar
            approaches, the novel model enables much stronger
            sparsification based on the RNA structure ensemble;
            consequently, SPARSE aligns and folds RNAs with
            similar alignment and better folding quality in
            significantly less time. Finally, SPARSE aligns
            ncRNAs from the challenging low sequence identity
            region more accurately than tools relying on
            sequence-based heuristics.  Conclusion: Our results
            indicate that a complete lightweight Sankoff-style
            model with stronger sparsification can increase the
            performance and accuracy of RNA alignment, where the
            potential of the model points far beyond the studied
            prototype. Not falling back on sequence comparison,
            SPARSE suggests itself for large scale similarity
            assessment of RNAs with moderate to very low
            sequence identity.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromatin loops are an essential factor in the 
            structural organization of the genome; however, their 
            detection in Hi-C interaction matrices is a challenging and 
            compute-intensive task. The approach presented here, 
            integrated into the HiCExplorer software, shows a chromatin 
            loop detection algorithm that applies a strict candidate 
            selection based on continuous negative binomial 
            distributions and performs a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to 
            detect enriched Hi-C interactions. RESULTS: HiCExplorer's 
            loop detection has a high detection rate and accuracy. It is 
            the fastest available CPU implementation and utilizes all 
            threads offered by modern multicore platforms. CONCLUSIONS: 
            HiCExplorer's method to detect loops by using a continuous 
            negative binomial function combined with the donut approach 
            from HiCCUPS leads to reliable and fast computation of 
            loops. All the loop-calling algorithms investigated provide 
            differing results, which intersect by $\sim 50\%$ at most. 
            The tested in situ Hi-C data contain a large amount of 
            noise; achieving better agreement between loop calling 
            algorithms will require cleaner Hi-C data and therefore 
            future improvements to the experimental methods that 
            generate the data.}

            method enables researchers to gain knowledge about the 
            chromatin state in individual cell levels. Single-cell Hi-C 
            interaction matrices are high dimensional and very sparse. 
            To cluster thousands of single-cell Hi-C interaction 
            matrices, they are flattened and compiled into one matrix. 
            Depending on the resolution, this matrix can have a few 
            million or even billions of features; therefore, 
            computations can be memory intensive. We present a 
            single-cell Hi-C clustering approach using an approximate 
            nearest neighbors method based on locality-sensitive hashing 
            to reduce the dimensions and the computational resources. 
            RESULTS: The presented method can process a 10 kb 
            single-cell Hi-C dataset with 2600 cells and needs 40 GB of 
            memory, while competitive approaches are not computable even 
            with 1 TB of memory. It can be shown that the 
            differentiation of the cells by their chromatin folding 
            properties and, therefore, the quality of the clustering of 
            single-cell Hi-C data is advantageous compared to 
            competitive algorithms. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The 
            presented clustering algorithm is part of the scHiCExplorer, 
            is available on Github 
            https://github.com/joachimwolff/scHiCExplorer, and as a

            Due to novel experimental methods on the genomic scale, biologists are
            struggling with ever increasing magnitudes of data that can, in many cases,
            only be harnessed by previous bioinformatics analyses. Currently many tools
            are either only accessible on the command line and web servers tend to lack
            easy usability. The Freiburg RNA Tools webserver aims at supplying an easy
            to use and comprehensive web resource for RNA analysis, also for nonadept
            users. We designed a webserver framework that simplifies the access
            to our RNA analysis tools. The tools are accompanied by extensive help
            pages and direct help requests are rapidly answered. All tools incorporate
            individual post processing steps that aid result interpretation. The results can
            be viewed in the browser and/or downloaded for further local analysis or
            archiving. Individual job descriptions can be entered by the user, thus
            alleviating personal online archiving. Furthermore, results are stored for 30
            days. The Freiburg RNA tools webserver currently integrates eight tools for
            RNA analysis. It includes CopraRNA (sRNA target prediction), LocARNA
            (alignment and folding), CARNA (ensemble alignment), MARNA
            (structure alignment), ExpaRNA (exact matching), INFORNA (sequence
            design), IntaRNA (RNA-RNA interaction) and CRISPRmap (CRISPR
            conservation). The addition of several further tools is under construction.

            class of bacterial gene expression regulators. Much like 
            eukaryotic microRNAs, these sRNAs typically target multiple 
            mRNAs through short seed pairing, thereby acting as global 
            posttranscriptional regulators. In some bacteria, evidence 
            for hundreds to possibly more than 1,000 different sRNAs has 
            been obtained by transcriptome sequencing. However, the 
            experimental identification of possible targets and, 
            therefore, their confirmation as functional regulators of 
            gene expression has remained laborious. Here, we present a 
            strategy that integrates phylogenetic information to predict 
            sRNA targets at the genomic scale and reconstructs 
            regulatory networks upon functional enrichment and network 
            analysis (CopraRNA, for Comparative Prediction Algorithm for 
            sRNA Targets). Furthermore, CopraRNA precisely predicts the 
            sRNA domains for target recognition and interaction. When 
            applied to several model sRNAs, CopraRNA revealed additional 
            targets and functions for the sRNAs CyaR, FnrS, RybB, RyhB, 
            SgrS, and Spot42. Moreover, the mRNAs gdhA, lrp, marA, nagZ, 
            ptsI, sdhA, and yobF-cspC were suggested as regulatory hubs 
            targeted by up to seven different sRNAs. The verification of 
            many previously undetected targets by CopraRNA, even for 
            extensively investigated sRNAs, demonstrates its advantages 
            and shows that CopraRNA-based analyses can compete with 
            experimental target prediction approaches. A Web interface 
            allows high-confidence target prediction and efficient 
            classification of bacterial sRNAs.}

            Thirty percent of retinal MG in areas of RNV were EdU-positive

            95\% TMEM119+ ramified human microglia-like cells (hiPSC-MG). In

            prostate cancer cell lines and tissues, we identified ARLNC1 
            (AR-regulated long noncoding RNA 1) as an important long

            by the AR protein, but ARLNC1 stabilized the AR transcript

            expression, global AR signaling and prostate cancer growth 
            in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data support a

            problem. Detecting such regions allows biologists to
            identify functionally relevant similarities between
            the inspected molecules. We developed dynamic
            programming algorithms for finding common
            structure-sequence patterns between two RNAs. The RNAs
            are given by their sequence and a set of potential

            to prior work on local pattern matching of RNAs, we
            support the breaking of arcs. This allows us to add
            flexibility over matching only fixed structures;
            potentially matching only a similar subset of
            specified base pairs. We present an $O(n^3)$ algorithm
            for local exact pattern matching between two nested
            RNAs, and an $O(n^3 log n)$ algorithm for one nested
            RNA and one bounded-unlimited RNA. In addition, an
            algorithm for approximate pattern matching is
            introduced that for two given nested RNAs and a number

            between the two RNAs with at most $k$ mismatches in
            $O(n^3k^2)$ time. Finally, we present an $O(n^3)$

            that can find optimal conformations in the cubic

            highperformance computing. These demands come from
            disciplines such as particle physics traditionally
            relying on High Performance Computing (HPC) but lately
            also from the various branches of life science that

            analysis of biological sequences, and is therefore
            well studied. In particular, the Smith-Waterman
            technique and its normalized version are two
            established metrics for measuring local similarity in
            strings. In RNA sequences however, where one must
            consider not only sequential but also structural
            features of the inspected molecules, the concept of
            local similarity becomes more complicated. First, even
            in global similarity, computing global
            sequence-structure alignments is more difficult than
            computing standard sequence alignments due to the
            bi-dimensionality of information. Second, one can view
            locality in two different ways, in the sequential or
            structural sense, leading to different problem
            formulations. In this paper we introduce two
            sequentially-local similarity metrics for comparing
            RNA sequences. These metrics combine the global RNA
            alignment metric of Shasha and Zhang [16] with the
            Smith-Waterman metric [17] and its normalized version
            [2] used in strings. We generalize the familiar
            alignment graph used in string comparison to apply
            also for RNA sequences, and then utilize this
            generalization to devise two algorithms for computing
            local similarity according to our two suggested
            metrics. Our algorithms run in O(m2n lg n) and O(m2n
            lg n+n2m) time respectively, where m  n are the
            lengths of the two given RNAs. Both algorithms can
            work with any arbitrary scoring scheme.}

            structure. For arbitrarily crossing input and
            consensus structures, the problem is NP-hard. For
            non-crossing consensus structures, Jiang et al's
            algorithm [1] computes the alignment in O(n^2 m^2 ) time
            where n and m denote the lengths of the two input
            sequences. If also the input structures are
            non-crossing, the problem n corresponds to tree
            editing which can be solved in O(m^2 n(1 + log n/m ))
            time [2]. We present a new algorithm that solves the

            non-crossing structures, bounded by n for crossing
            structures, and much smaller than n on most practical
            examples. Crossing input structures allow for

            to reduce the time and space complexities of this

abstract = {Large RNA molecules often carry multiple functional
            domains whose spatial arrangement is an important
            determinant of their function. Pre-mRNA splicing,
            furthermore, relies on the spatial proximity of the
            splice junctions that can be separated by very long
            introns. Similar e
            ects appear in the processing of
            RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the
            distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic
            equilibrium therefore provides useful information on
            the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights
            into the interplay of its functional domains. Spatial
            distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in
            RNA secondary structure. We show here that the
            equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between
            arbitrary nucleotides can be computed in polynomial
            time by means of dynamic programming. A naive
            implementation would yield recursions with a very high
            time complexity of O(n11). Although we were able to
            reduce this to O(n6) for many practical applications a
            further reduction seems dicult. We conclude,
            therefore, that sampling approaches, which are much
            easier to implement, are also theoretically favorable
            for most real-life applications, in particular since
            these primarily concern long-range interactions in
            very large RNA molecules.}

            We developed a dynamic programming approach of computing common
            sequence/structure patterns between two RNAs given by their sequence
            and secondary structures. Common patterns between two RNAs are meant
            to share the same local sequential and structural properties.
            Nucleotides which are part of an RNA are linked together due to
            their phosphodiester or hydrogen bonds. These bonds describe the way
            how nucleotides are involved in patterns and thus delivers a
            bond-preserving matching definition. Based on this definition, we
            are able to compute all patterns between two RNAs in time O(nm)
            and space O(nm), where n and m are the lengths of the RNAs,
            respectively.  Our method is useful for describing and detecting
            local motifs and for detecting local regions of large RNAs although
            they do not share global similarities.}

            There  are  two  major  approaches  to  formal  accounts  of  the  syntax  of  natural  language,  the  proof-theoretic  and  the  model-theoretic  approach.  Both  aim  at  providing  frameworks  for  answering  the  question  whether  a  given  natural  language  expression  is  grammatical.  Their  methodology,  however,  is  rather  different:  In  a  proof-theoretic  framework,  one  tries  to  set  up  a  system  of  derivation  rules  (such  as  the  rules  in  a  context-free  grammar)  so  that  each  well-formed  natural  language  expression  stands  in  correspondence  with  a  derivation  in  that  system.  In  contrast,  in  a  model-theoretic  framework,  one  attempts  to  specify  a  class  of  models  for  natural  language  expressions  and  a  set  of  constraints  on  these  models  such  that  an  expression  is  well-formed  iff  it  has  a  model  satisfying  all  the  constraints.  The  main  contribution  of  this  paper  is  the  characterisation  of  a  class  of  structures  that  provides  a  new  model-based  perspective  on  Tree  Adjoining  Grammar  (Joshi  and  Schabes  (1997)),  a  well-known  proof-theoretic  syntactic  framework.}

While pipelines are available to analyze Ribo-seq data, none are designed explicitly for the automatic processing and analysis of data from bacteria, nor are they focused on the discovery of unannotated open reading frames (ORFs).We present HRIBO (High-throughput annotation by Ribo-seq), a workflow to enable reproducible and high-throughput analysis of bacterial Ribo-seq data. The workflow performs all required pre-processing and quality control steps. Importantly, HRIBO outputs annotation-independent ORF predictions based on two complementary bacteria-focused tools, and integrates them with additional feature information and expression values.

This is often carried out by using Hidden Markov Models and manual annotation. In this article, we propose the first method able to automatically define the cassette boundaries. In addition, we present a Cas-type predictive model used by the method to assign each gene located in the region defined by a cassette’s boundaries a Cas label from a set of pre-defined Cas types. Furthermore, the proposed method can detect potentially new cas genes and decompose a cassette into its modules.We evaluate the predictive performance of our proposed method on data collected from the two most recent CRISPR classification studies. In our experiments, we obtain an average similarity of 0.86 between the predicted and expected cassettes. Besides, we achieve F-scores above 0.9 for the classification of cas genes of known types and 0.73 for the unknown ones. Finally, we conduct two additional study cases, where we investigate the occurrence of potentially new cas genes and the occurrence of module exchange between different genomes.https://github.com/BackofenLab/Casboundary.alkhanbo@informatik.uni-freiburg.de or backofen@informatik.uni-freiburg.deSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}}

            accessibility and the interaction free energies. Our
            algorithm maintains tractability and speed and also
            has two important advantages over previous similar
            approaches: 1) it is able to predict multiple
            simultaneous binding sites and 2) it computes a more
            accurate interaction free energy by considering both
            intramolecular and intermolecular base
            pairing. Moreover, biRNA can handle crossing
            interactions as well as hairpins interacting in a
            zigzag fashion. 
            
            To deal with simultaneous
            accessibility of binding sites, our algorithm models
            their joint probability of being unpaired. Since
            computing the exact joint probability distribution is
            intractable, we approximate the joint probability by a
            polynomially representable graphical model namely a
            Chow-Liu tree-structured Markov Random
            Field. Experimental results show that biRNA
            outperforms RNAup and also support the accuracy of our
            approach. Our proposed Bayesian approximation of the

            prediction combined with machine learning as the basis to 
            identify the two main classes of small nucleolar RNAs, the 
            box H/ACA snoRNAs and the box C/D snoRNAs. Here, we present 
            snoReport 2.0, which substantially improves and extends in 
            the original method by: extracting new features for both box 
            C/D and H/ACA box snoRNAs; developing a more sophisticated 
            technique in the SVM training phase with recent data from 
            vertebrate organisms and a careful choice of the SVM 
            parameters C and gamma; and using updated versions of tools 
            and databases used for the construction of the original 
            version of snoReport. To validate the new version and to 
            demonstrate its improved performance, we tested snoReport 
            2.0 in different organisms. RESULTS: Results of the training 
            and test phases of boxes H/ACA and C/D snoRNAs, in both 
            versions of snoReport, are discussed. Validation on real 
            data was performed to evaluate the predictions of snoReport 
            2.0. Our program was applied to a set of previously 
            annotated sequences, some of them experimentally confirmed, 
            of humans, nematodes, drosophilids, platypus, chickens and 
            leishmania. We significantly improved the predictions for 
            vertebrates, since the training phase used information of 
            these organisms, but H/ACA box snoRNAs identification was 
            improved for the other ones. CONCLUSION: We presented 
            snoReport 2.0, to predict H/ACA box and C/D box snoRNAs, an 
            efficient method to find true positives and avoid false 
            positives in vertebrate organisms. H/ACA box snoRNA 
            classifier showed an F-score of 93 % (an improvement of 10 % 
            regarding the previous version), while C/D box snoRNA 
            classifier, an F-Score of 94 % (improvement of 14 %). 
            Besides, both classifiers exhibited performance measures 
            above 90 %. These results show that snoReport 2.0 avoid 
            false positives and false negatives, allowing to predict 
            snoRNAs with high quality. In the validation phase, 
            snoReport 2.0 predicted 67.43 % of vertebrate organisms for 
            both classes. For Nematodes and Drosophilids, 69 % and 76.67 
            %, for H/ACA box snoRNAs were predicted, respectively, 
            showing that snoReport 2.0 is good to identify snoRNAs in 
            vertebrates and also H/ACA box snoRNAs in invertebrates 
            organisms.}

As a central player in key processes regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of experiments, addressing different aspects of biological questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a single framework. Only then is it possible to connect findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. target predictions. To address these needs, we present the RNA Workbench 2.0, an updated online resource for RNA related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that enables researchers to analyze their data without the need for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the established framework to the next level, providing not only a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data exploration, and visualization. The new framework is available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu, and login is free and open to all users. The containerized version can be found at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}

abstract = {RNA has become one of the major research topics in molecular biology. As a central player in key processes regulating gene expression, RNA is in the focus of many efforts to decipher the pathways that govern the transition of genetic information to a fully functional cell. As more and more researchers join this endeavour, there is a rapidly growing demand for comprehensive collections of tools that cover the diverse layers of RNA-related research. However, increasing amounts of data, from diverse types of experiments, addressing different aspects of biological questions need to be consolidated and integrated into a single framework. Only then is it possible to connect findings from e.g. RNA-Seq experiments and methods for e.g. target predictions. To address these needs, we present the RNA Workbench 2.0 , an updated online resource for RNA related analysis. With the RNA Workbench we created a comprehensive set of analysis tools and workflows that enables researchers to analyze their data without the need for sophisticated command-line skills. This update takes the established framework to the next level, providing not only a containerized infrastructure for analysis, but also a ready-to-use platform for hands-on training, analysis, data exploration, and visualization. The new framework is available at https://rna.usegalaxy.eu , and login is free and open to all users. The containerized version can be found at https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench.}

            This  paper  introduces  Lexicalised  Configuration  Grammar  (LCGs),  a  new  declarative  framework  for  natural  language  syntax.  LCG  is  powerful  enough  to  encode  a  large  number  of  existing  grammar  formalisms,  facilitating  their  comparison  from  the  perspective  of  graph  configuration.  Once  a  formalism  has  been  encoded  as  an  LCG,  the  framework  offers  various  means  to  increase  its  expressivity  in  a  controlled  manner;  trading  expressive  power  for  computational  complexity,  this  makes  it  possible  to  model  syntactic  phenomena  in  novel  ways.  Parsing  algorithms  for  LCGs  lend  themselves  to  a  combination  of  chart-based  and  constraint-based  processing  techniques,  allowing  both  to  bring  in  their  strengths.}

            The  ability  to  represent  cross-serial  dependencies  is  one  of  the  central  features  of  Tree  Adjoining  Grammar  (TAG).

            Dependency-based  representations  of  natural  language  syntax  require  a  fine  balance  between  structural  flexibility  and  computational  complexity.  In  previous  work,  several  constraints  have  been  proposed  to  identify  classes  of  dependency  structures  that  are  well-balanced  in  this  sense;  the  best-known  but  also  most  restrictive  of  these  is  projectivity.

            Several machine learning problems can be naturally defined over graph data. Recently, many researchers have been focusing on the definition of neural networks for graphs. The core idea is to learn a hidden representation for the graph vertices, with a convolutive or recurrent mechanism. When considering discriminative tasks on graphs, such as classification or regression, one critical component to design is the readout function, i.e. the mapping from the set of vertex representations to a fixed-size vector (or the output). Different approaches have been presented in literature, but recent approaches tend to be complex, making the training of the whole network harder. In this paper, we frame the problem in the setting of learning over sets. Adopting recently proposed theorems over functions defined on sets, we propose a simple but powerful formulation for a readout layer that can encode or approximate arbitrarily well any continuous permutation-invariant function over sets. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets show that, compared to other approaches, the proposed readout architecture can improve the predictive performance of Graph Neural Networks while being computationally more efficient.}

abstract = {Motivation:Biological research produces a wealth of
            measured data. Neither it is easy for biologists to
            postulate hypotheses about the behaviour or structure
            of the observed entity because the relevant properties
            measured are not seen in the ocean of
            measurements. Nor it is easy to design machine
            learning algorithms to classify or cluster the data
            items  for the same reason. Algorithms for
            automatically selecting a highly predictive subset of
            the measured features can help to overcome these
            difficulties.Results: We present an efficient feature
            selection strategy which can be applied to arbitrary
            feature selection problems. The core technique is a
            new method for estimating the quality of subsets from
            previously calculated qualities for smaller subsets by
            minimising the mean standard error of estimated values
            with an approach common to support vector
            machines. This method can be integrated in many
            feature subset search algorithms. We have applied it
            with sequential search algorithms and have been able
            to reduce the number of quality calculations for
            finding accurate feature subsets by about $70\%$. We
            show these improvements by applying our approach to
            the problem of finding highly predictive feature
            subsets for transcription factor binding sites.}

abstract = {Small proteins encoded by short open reading frames (ORFs) with 50 codons or fewer are emerging as an important class of cellular macromolecules in diverse organisms. However, they often evade detection by proteomics or in silico methods. Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) has revealed widespread translation in genomic regions previously thought to be non-coding, driving the development of ORF detection tools using Ribo-seq data. However, only a handful of tools have been designed for bacteria, and these have not yet been systematically compared. Here, we aimed to identify tools that use Ribo-seq data to correctly determine the translational status of annotated bacterial ORFs and also discover novel translated regions with high sensitivity. To this end, we generated a large set of annotated ORFs from four diverse bacterial organisms, manually labeled for their translation status based on Ribo-seq data, which are available for future benchmarking studies. This set was used to investigate the predictive performance of seven Ribo-seq-based ORF detection tools (REPARATION\_blast, DeepRibo, Ribo-TISH, PRICE, smORFer, ribotricer and SPECtre), as well as IRSOM, which uses coding potential and RNA-seq coverage only. DeepRibo and REPARATION\_blast robustly predicted translated ORFs, including sORFs, with no significant difference for ORFs in close proximity to other genes versus stand-alone genes. However, no tool predicted a set of novel, experimentally verified sORFs with high sensitivity. Start codon predictions with smORFer show the value of initiation site profiling data to further improve the sensitivity of ORF prediction tools in bacteria. Overall, we find that bacterial tools perform well for sORF detection, although there is potential for improving their performance, applicability, usability and reproducibility.}

            the model. We also show the approximability of the problem, by giving
            a practical Θ(n3) algorithm that achieves at least a 5-approximation for
            any parametrization of the stacking model. This contrasts nicely with
            the nearest-neighbor version of the problem, which we prove cannot be

            Ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) provides a means to analyze active translation by determining ribosome occupancy in a transcriptome-wide manner. 
            The vast majority of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) resides within the protein-coding sequence of mRNAs. However, commonly reads are also found within the transcript leader sequence (TLS) (aka 5' untranslated region) preceding the main open reading frame (ORF), indicating the translation of regulatory upstream ORFs (uORFs). 
            Here, we present a workflow for the identification of translation-regulatory uORFs. Specifically, uORF-Tools uses Ribo-TISH to identify uORFs within a given dataset and generates a uORF annotation file. In addition, a comprehensive human uORF annotation file, based on 35 ribo-seq files, is provided, which can serve as an alternative input file for the workflow. 
            To assess the translation-regulatory activity of the uORFs, stimulus-induced changes in the ratio of the RPFs residing in the main ORFs relative to those found in the associated uORFs are determined. The resulting output file allows for the easy identification of candidate uORFs, which have translation-inhibitory effects on their associated main ORFs.
            uORF-Tools is available as a free and open Snakemake workflow at https://github.com/Biochemistry1-FFM/uORF-Tools. It is easily installed and all necessary tools are provided in a version-controlled manner, which also ensures lasting usability. uORF-Tools is designed for intuitive use and requires only limited computing times and resources.}

So far, there are no studies available that closer observe this issue. Here we show that current peak callers are susceptible to false peak calling near exon borders. We quantify its extent in publicly available datasets, which turns out to be substantial. By providing a tool called CLIPcontext for automatic transcript and genomic context sequence extraction, we further demonstrate that context choice affects the performances of RBP binding site prediction tools. Moreover, we show that known motifs of exon-binding RBPs are often enriched in transcript context sites, which should enable the recovery of more authentic binding sites. Finally, we discuss possible strategies on how to integrate transcript information into future workflows. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating transcript information in CLIP-seq data analysis. Taking advantage of the underlying transcript information should therefore become an integral part of future peak calling and downstream analysis tools.}

However, a full understanding of their importance has been hampered by insufficient genome annotations and a lack of comprehensive characterization in microbes other than Escherichia coli. We have taken an integrative approach to accelerate the discovery of small proteins and their putative virulence-associated functions in Salmonella Typhimurium. We merged the annotated small proteome of Salmonella with new small proteins predicted with in silico and experimental approaches. We then exploited existing and newly generated global datasets that provide information on small open reading frame expression during infection of epithelial cells (dual RNA-seq), contribution to bacterial fitness inside macrophages (Transposon-directed insertion sequencing), and potential engagement in molecular interactions (Grad-seq). This integrative approach suggested a new role for the small protein MgrB beyond its known function in regulating PhoQ. We demonstrate a virulence and motility defect of a Salmonella delta-mgrB mutant and reveal an effect of MgrB in regulating the Salmonella transcriptome and proteome under infection-relevant conditions. Our study highlights the power of interpreting available omics datasets with a focus on small proteins, and may serve as a blueprint for a data integration-based survey of small proteins in diverse bacteria.}}
