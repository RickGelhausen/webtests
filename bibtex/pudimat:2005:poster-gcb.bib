  abstract =	 {The prediction of matches to probabilistic 
sequences motifs within biological sequence is a key task of computational biology. 
Since single hits of these short  motifs tend to be 
false positives, 
recent research is concentrating on additional biological knowledge for
separating real matches from background. Especially 
the preference of various motifs to occur in combination with  
other motifs (clusters) seems to have exquisite filtering properties. 
Often, there are constraints about order, distance and orientation
among the members of such clusters. Examples are functionally related transcription
factor binding sites and alternative splice enhancers.
We present a strategy for modelling the sequence properties of single
motifs and the motif match arrangements of related motifs},
