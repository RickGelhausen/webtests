  abstract =	 {Many computational problems concerning RNA
                  pseudoknot structures, most prominently their
                  prediction and alignment, are NP-hard. For structure
                  prediction, several algorithms have been proposed
                  that are restricted to certain classes of
                  pseudoknots in order to run efficiently. We present
                  a general scheme that yields an efficient alignment
                  algorithm for arbitrary classes of pseudoknots that
                  can be predicted efficiently by dynamic
                  programming. Moreover, we show that such an
                  alignment algorithm benefits from restrictions to
                  certain structure classes in the same way as
                  structure prediction algorithms do. We look at five
                  of these classes in greater detail. Compared to the
                  respective structure prediction algorithm, the time
                  and space complexity of the obtained alignment
                  algorithm is increased by only a linear factor. For
                  four of the classes, there do not exist alignment
                  algorithms so far. For the fifth, most general
                  class, our algorithm improves the time complexity
                  compared to the best algorithm known so far, from
                  $O(n^5m^5)$ time to $O(nm^6)$, where $n$ and $m$ are
                  the length of the two aligned sequences. Finally, we
                  apply the fastest of the generated algorithms with
                  complexity $O(nm^4)$ time and $O(nm^2)$ space to
                  comparative de-novo prediction of pseudoknots.}
