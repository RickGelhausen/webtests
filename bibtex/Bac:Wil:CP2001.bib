  abstract =	 {Lattice protein models are used for hierarchical
                  approaches to protein structure prediction, as well
                  as for investigating principles of protein
                  folding. So far, one has the problem that there
                  exists no lattice that can model real protein
                  conformations with good quality \emph{and} for which
                  an efficient method to find native conformations is
                  known. We present the first method for the
                  FCC-HP-Model [Agarwala et al., JCB 97] that is
                  capable of finding native conformations for
                  real-sized HP-sequences. It has been shown [Park and
                  Levitt, JMB 95] that the FCC lattice can model real
                  protein conformations with coordinate root mean
                  square deviation below 2 \AA. Our method uses a
                  constraint-based approach. It works by first
                  calculating maximally compact sets of points
                  (hydrophobic cores), and then threading the given
                  HP-sequence to the hydrophobic cores such that the
                  core is occupied by H-monomers. },
