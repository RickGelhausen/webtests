        abstract = {features given by Smolka & Treinen 1992 is
                    complete. In contrast to other completeness proofs
                    that have been given in this field, we employ the
                    method of Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Games. The result
                    extends previous results on complete axiomatizations
                    of rational trees in the language of constructor
                    equations (Comon & Lescanne 1988, Maher 1988) or in
                    a weaker feature language as given by Backofen &
                    Smolka 1993.}
