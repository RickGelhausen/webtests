  abstract =     {We introduce a new method for excluding symmetries in
                  constraint based search. To our knowledge, it is the
                  first declarative method that can be applied to {\em
                  arbitrary} symmetries. Our method is based on the
                  notion of symmetric constraints, which are used in our
                  modification of a general constraint based search
                  algorithm. The method does not influence the search
                  strategy. Furthermore, it can be used with either the
                  full set of symmetries, or with an subset of all
                  symmetries. 

                  We proof correctness, completeness and
                  symmetry exclusion properties of our method. Then, we
                  show how to apply the method in the special case of
                  geometric symmetries (rotations and reflections) and
                  permutation symmetries. Furthermore, we give results
                  from practical applications.},
