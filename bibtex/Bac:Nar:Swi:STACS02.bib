  abstract =     {We address the problem of finding an mRNA sequence
                  satisfying the constraints posed by an input graph and
                  associated functions which model bond structure and
                  similarity requirements.  We show that the problem of
                  deciding if an mRNA sequence exists, satisfying the
                  given constraints, is NP-complete.  For a special
                  class of well motivated input graphs we present
                  polynomial time algorithms that solve the related
                  optimization problem exactly.  Using this algorithm we
                  design constant factor approximation algorithms for
                  the more general case.}
