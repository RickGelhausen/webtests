abstract  = {
    The prediction of transcription factor binding sites is an important
    problem, since it reveals information about the transcriptional regulation
    of genes. A commonly used representation of these sites are position
    specific weight matrices which show weak predictive power.
    We introduce a feature-based modelling approach, which is able to deal with
    various kind of biological properties of binding sites and models them
    via em Bayesian belief networks. The presented results imply higher
    model accuracy in contrast to the PSSM approach.
