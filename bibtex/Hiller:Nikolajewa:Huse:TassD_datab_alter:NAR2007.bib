  abstract =	 {Subtle alternative splice events at tandem splice sites are 
                  frequent in eukaryotes and substantially increase the 
                  complexity of transcriptomes and proteomes. We have 
                  developed a relational database, TassDB (TAndem Splice Site 
                  DataBase), which stores extensive data about alternative 
                  splice events at GYNGYN donors and NAGNAG acceptors. These 
                  splice events are of subtle nature since they mostly result 
                  in the insertion/deletion of a single amino acid or the 
                  substitution of one amino acid by two others. Currently, 
                  TassDB contains 114 554 tandem splice sites of eight 
                  species, 5209 of which have EST/mRNA evidence for 
                  alternative splicing. In addition, human SNPs that affect 
                  NAGNAG acceptors are annotated. The database provides a 
                  user-friendly interface to search for specific genes or for 
                  genes containing tandem splice sites with specific features 
                  as well as the possibility to download large datasets. This 
                  database should facilitate further experimental studies and 
                  large-scale bioinformatics analyses of tandem splice sites. 
                  The database is available at 
                  http://helios.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/TassDB/.}
