The  ability  to  represent  cross-serial  dependencies  is  one  of  the  central  features  of  Tree  Adjoining  Grammar  (TAG).  The  class  of  dependency  structures  representable  by  lexicalized  TAG  derivations  can  be  captured  by  two  graph-theoretic  properties:  a  bound  on  the  gap  degree  of  the  structures,  and  a  constraint  called  well-nestedness.  In  this  paper,  we  compare  formalisms  from  two  strands  of  extensions  to  TAG  in  the  context  of  the  question,  how  they  behave  with  respect  to  these  constraints.  In  particular,  we  show  that  multi-component  TAG  does  not  necessarily  retain  the  well-nestedness  constraint,  while  this  constraint  is  inherent  to  Coupled  Context-Free  Grammar  (Hotz  and  Pitsch,  1996).
