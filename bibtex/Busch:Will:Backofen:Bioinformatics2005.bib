  abstract =	 {SUMMARY: SECISDesign is a server for the design of 
                  SECIS-elements and arbitrary RNA-elements within the coding 
                  sequence of an mRNA. The element has to satisfy both 
                  structure and sequence constraints. At the same time, a 
                  certain amino acid similarity to the original protein has to 
                  be kept. The designed sequence can be used for recombinant 
                  expression of selenoproteins in Escherichia coli. 
                  AVAILABILITY: The server is available at 
                  http://www.bio.inf.uni-jena.de/Software/SECISDesign/index.html.}
