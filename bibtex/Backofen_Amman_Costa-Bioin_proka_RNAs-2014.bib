  abstract =	 {The genome of most prokaryotes gives rise to surprisingly 
                  complex transcriptomes, comprising not only protein-coding 
                  mRNAs, often organized as operons, but also harbors dozens 
                  or even hundreds of highly structured small regulatory RNAs 
                  and unexpectedly large levels of anti-sense transcripts. 
                  Comprehensive surveys of prokaryotic transcriptomes and the 
                  need to characterize also their non-coding components is 
                  heavily dependent on computational methods and workflows, 
                  many of which have been developed or at least adapted 
                  specifically for the use with bacterial and archaeal data. 
                  This review provides an overview on the state-of-the-art of 
                  RNA bioinformatics focusing on applications to prokaryotes.}
